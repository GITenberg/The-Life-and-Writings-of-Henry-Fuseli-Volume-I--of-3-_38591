<span style="margin-left: 2em;">MADAM,</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I feel</span> a degree of diffidence in dedicating to your Ladyship the Life
and Posthumous Works of Henry Fuseli; because, with regard to the
former, no one is better acquainted with the extent of his talents, or
can form a more accurate opinion of the powers of his conversation, and
the excellent qualities of his head and heart, than yourself. In giving
some account of his life and pursuits, I have endeavoured to speak of
him as he was, and to become his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span> "honest chronicler." How far I have
succeeded, it is for your Ladyship to form a judgment. Had it ever
occurred to me, during his lifetime, that it would be my lot to become
his Biographer, I should have kept a Journal, and thus have been enabled
to present to you, and to the world, a more copious and rich view of his
colloquial powers. But as this is not the case, if the Memoir bring to
your remembrance the general power of his genius, or give an adumbration
of his professional merit; if it convey impressions of his profound
classical attainments and critical knowledge, and recall with them the
simplicity of his domestic habits, my end is fully answered.</p>

<p>It is not for me to make an apology for sending to the public, under the
high support of your Ladyship's name, the posthumous works of my friend;
as these, I know, will be acceptable to you; and many of them have
already received the highest encomiums, when delivered as Lectures
before the Members of the Royal Academy of Arts.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span></p>

<p>I am fully certain that if the mind which dictated these works, could
now be conscious of the fact, no circumstance would give to it greater
satisfaction, than the knowledge of their appearing under the sanction
of your patronage.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I have the honour to subscribe myself,</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Madam,</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Your Ladyship's most obedient,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 5em;">And obliged humble servant,</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">JOHN KNOWLES.</span><br />

<h4><br />ADVERTISEMENT.</h4>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> offering to the public the Life and a complete edition of the
literary Works of Henry Fuseli, I feel myself called upon to state the
sources whence the former has been drawn.</p>

<p>The daily intercourse and sincere friendship which subsisted for many
years between this great artist and myself, afforded me the opportunity
of witnessing his domestic habits, hearing many of the incidents of his
life, and watching his career as an artist; and, being executor to his
will, his professional as well as private papers came into my
possession. Independently of these advantages, I have been in
correspondence with the nearest branches of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
his family, (at Zurich, in
Switzerland,) and from their kindness have obtained many particulars of
his early life, together with the correction of some previously
inaccurate dates. Whatever estimate, therefore, may be formed of my
work, as a literary production, the particulars have been gathered from
the most authentic and unquestionable sources.</p>

<p>With respect to his works, it may be necessary to state that the first
Six Lectures were published in a quarto volume under Mr. Fuseli's own
superintendence, and were printed in a more extended form than that in
which they were delivered; additional observations having been inserted
for the press, and notes added to indicate the authorities whence his
opinions were derived. They are now reprinted from a copy in my
possession, in which are noted some corrections by the author.</p>

<p>The remaining Six Lectures are published from the manuscripts in his own
hand-writing, without any addition, omission, or alteration.</p>

<p>The Aphorisms were collated, and re-copied fairly some years before the
death of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span> author: these are printed <i>verbatim</i> as he intended they
should come before the public.</p>

<p>The History of the Italian Schools of Art will be found to contain the
professional lives of Michael Angelo, Raffaelle, Titian, Correggio, and
other great masters, with the author's criticisms on their works. Most
of the observations on Art were made by Fuseli while in Italy and
France, after a close inspection of the frescoes, pictures, or works in
sculpture, which he describes or criticises; and the particulars of the
lives of the artists were deduced from a careful perusal and comparison
of the most elaborate and esteemed works in which they have been
recorded.</p>

<p>The reader will notice, that, in a few instances, the same notions and
expressions are repeated; a circumstance which occasioned from an
eminent artist, (the late Sir Thomas Lawrence,) for whose opinion and
talents I had great respect, a recommendation to "use the
pruning-knife." But it appeared to me, after due consideration, to be
preferable that I should print the manuscripts as they came into my
hands; for to have omitted these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
passages might have disturbed the
connexion of the reasoning and rendered the author's ideas less apparent
to the reader; I therefore present his works to the world without any
omission, alteration, or addition on my part.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">As</span> there is a natural wish in mankind to be made acquainted with the
history of those men who have distinguished themselves by any
extraordinary exertion of talent, so we always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span> experience regret when
we look to the biography of a celebrated man, if we find the details
scanty, or the particulars respecting him resting for their accuracy
upon the uncertainty of oral communication, made after a lapse of
several years.</p>

<p>Although the mind of an author may, at a remote period, be appreciated
by a perusal of his works, and the capacity and talents of an artist be
judged of by the powers of invention which he has displayed,&mdash;by the
harmony of his colour and the style and correctness of his lines; yet
these do not completely satisfy; we wish the more to see him in his
closet, to pursue him into familiar life, and to be made acquainted with
the paths which he trod and the mode of study which he adopted to arrive
at eminence. Who does not feel this impulse when he peruses the meagre
accounts we have received of Shakspeare or Correggio? although the
utmost efforts of industry have been employed to collect facts relating
to these extraordinary men.</p>

<p>It is with such feelings that I attempt to give some particulars of the
life and professional career of Henry Fuseli, while they are fresh on
the memory; for if the biography of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span> particular man be not written
during his lifetime, or shortly after his decease, we recollect perhaps
only a few circumstances, and fill up the record by guessing at the
rest.</p>

<p>Many of the incidents which I am about to relate respecting Mr. Fuseli
were communicated by himself; for I had the happiness of enjoying his
friendship uninterruptedly for twenty years, and was almost in the daily
habit of seeing and conversing with him until the last period of his
existence. Other particulars I have collected from some of his relations
and friends, and gleaned much from his private papers, which fell into
my possession, as executor to his will. The facts may therefore be
relied upon, and they will, at least, assist some future biographer: for
I feel the difficulties under which I must unavoidably labour, in
attempting to display the powers of a highly gifted man, and an eminent
professor in an art which requires the study of years, nay of a whole
life, to understand in any competent degree.</p>

<p>Henry Füessli (for such is the family name), the second son of John
Caspar Füessli, was born on the 7th February, 1741, N.S. at Zurich, in
Switzerland, which city had been the native place of his family for many
generations.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>His father, John Caspar, a painter of portraits and sometimes of
landscapes, was distinguished for his literary attainments; when young,
he had travelled into Germany, and became a pupil of Kupetzky, the most
celebrated portrait painter of his time. He then resided for some time
at Rastadt, as portrait painter to that court; and afterwards went to
Ludswigsbourg, with letters of recommendation to the Prince of
Wirtemberg, and was particularly patronized by him.</p>

<p>In the war of 1733, a French army having entered Germany, threw every
thing there into confusion, on which Füessli withdrew from the scene of
military operations, to Nuremberg, and remained in that city for six
months, in expectation of a termination of hostilities; but hearing of
the fall of his patron, the Prince of Wirtemberg, in the field of
battle, he returned to Zurich, and settled in Switzerland for life.</p>

<p>Shortly after his return to his native city, he married Elizabeth Waser,
an excellent woman, but of retired habits, who confined her attention to
the care of her house and family, and to the perusal of religious books.
By this marriage he had eighteen children, three of whom only arrived at
the age of manhood;&mdash;Rodolph, who followed his father's profession as a
painter, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span> afterwards, settling at Vienna, became librarian to the
Emperor of Germany; Henry, the subject of this Memoir; and Caspar, well
known for his able and discriminative works on entomology.</p>

<p>Although John Caspar Füessli, the father, had travelled much, and was
not unacquainted with the manners of courts, and could practise, when he
thought proper, those of a courtier, yet he had assumed the carriage of
an independent man of the world, and acquired an abrupt and blunt manner
of speaking. Yet, as he was endowed with learning and possessed of
talents, his house was frequented by men the most eminent in literature
and in the arts, in Zurich and its neighbourhood. He was also an author,
and, among other works, published the Lives of the Helvetic Painters, in
which he received considerable assistance, both in its arrangement and
style, from his son Henry. This he was enabled to do, notwithstanding,
to use his own words, "in boyhood, when the mind first becomes capable
of receiving the rudiments of knowledge, he had not the advantage of the
amalgamating tuition of a public school."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> </p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Henry Fuseli not only profited in his early years by the instruction of
his parents, but also by the society which his father kept; indeed, he
may be said to have been rocked in his cradle by the Muses,&mdash;for Solomon
Gessner was his godfather. This poet and painter was the intimate friend
of the elder Fuseli, and addressed to him an elaborate letter on
landscape-painting, which is published in his works. But it was to his
mother that Henry considered himself chiefly indebted for the rudiments
of his education: she, it appears, was a woman of superior talents, and
possessed, in a high degree, the affection and gratitude of her
children. Even in the latter days of his life, when Fuseli has spoken of
his mother, I have seen tears start into his eyes.</p>

<p>Henry Fuseli showed, very early, a predilection for drawing, and also
for entomology; but the former was checked by his father, who knowing,
from his own pursuits, the difficulty of arriving at any eminence in the
fine arts, except a man's whole mind and attention be given to them; and
having designed his son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span> Henry for the clerical profession, under the
expectation of advantageous preferment for him in the church, he
considered that any pursuit requiring more than ordinary attention would
draw his mind from those studies which appertain to theology, and thus
be injurious to his future prospects. Perhaps, too, his dislike to his
son's being an artist may also have arisen from the notion, that he
would never excel in the mechanical part of painting; for, in youth, he
had so great an awkwardness of hands, that his parents would not permit
him to touch any thing liable to be broken or injured. His father has
often exclaimed, when such things were shown to his visitors, "Take care
of that boy, for he destroys or spoils whatever he touches."</p>

<p>Although the love which Fuseli had for the fine arts might be checked,
yet it was not to be diverted altogether; this pursuit, which was denied
him by parental authority, was secretly indulged,&mdash;for he bought with
his small allowance of pocket-money, candles, pencils, paper, &amp;c., in
order to make drawings when his parents believed him to be in bed. These
he sold to his companions; the produce of which enabled him either to
purchase materials for the execution of other drawings, or to add
articles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span> to his wardrobe, such as his parents might withhold, from
prudential motives.</p>

<p>Many of his early sketches are still preserved, one of which is now in
my possession,&mdash;"Orestes pursued by the Furies." The subjects which he
chose were either terrific or ludicrous scenes: in both these, he at all
periods of life excelled: although his early works are incorrect in
point of drawing, yet they generally tell the story which they intend to
represent, with a wonderful felicity, particularly when it is considered
that several of them proceeded from the mind of a mere child, scarcely
eleven years of age.</p>

<p>The work which most engrossed Fuseli's juvenile attention was Tobias
Stimmer's field-sports: these subjects he copied diligently, either with
a pen or in Indian ink, as well as the sketches of Christopher Maurer,
Gotthard Ringgli, Jobst Ammann, and other masters of Zurich. These
artists, it must be acknowledged, possessed great powers of invention,
and had a firm and bold outline, yet their figures are not to be
commended for proportions or elegance, and the mannerism of their works
was a dangerous example for a student to follow. It is not surprising,
therefore, that we find an imitation of their faults in the early
drawings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span> Fuseli; in which short and clumsy figures are generally
draped in the old Swiss <i>costume</i>.</p>

<p>Although the father seldom or ever attended public worship, yet he was
not ignorant of the principles of religion, and knew what would be
expected from his son when he entered upon the clerical profession: in
order, therefore, to initiate him in the doctrines which he intended he
should teach, he employed a clergyman to assist him in these as well as
to instruct him in the classics. From this gentleman he borrowed the
most esteemed religious books, which it was his practice, in the
evenings, to read aloud to Henry. But while the father was reading the
paraphrases of Doddridge, or the sermons of Götz or Saurin, the son was
not unfrequently employed in making drawings; and the better to escape
observation, he used his left hand for that purpose. This practice made
him ambidextrous during his life.</p>

<p>The tutor soon perceived the bent of his pupil's inclination, who,
instead of making his themes, or attending to other studies, was
caricaturing those about him; and he told his father that, although he
had an uncommon capacity for whatever he undertook with ardour, yet he
was so wayward in his disposition, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span> so bent upon drawing, that it
was doubtful whether he would ever become a scholar.</p>

<p>The health of Mrs. Füessli being in a very delicate state, the family
removed a few miles from the city, for the benefit of the air. Henry was
at this time about twelve years of age. A residence in the country
opened to his active mind a new field for contemplation, in the study of
nature; and he now found great delight in what he had before in a degree
pursued,&mdash;entomology. This study his father allowed him to prosecute, as
he considered that the attempt to gain a knowledge of a science</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Which looks through Nature up to Nature's God,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>would be advantageous to his future walk in life; he therefore indulged
his wish, encouraged him to proceed, and furnished him with books by
which he could get information respecting the genera of insects, and
their habits.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> And in the pursuit of entomology he was usually
accompanied by his younger brother, Caspar, who has written so ably upon
this science; and I have often heard Henry enlarge, in glowing terms,
upon the pleasurable sensations which he experienced, when a boy, from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the freshness of the air, at the dawn of day, when he had been creeping
through hedge-rows in search of the larvæ of insects, or in pursuit of
the disturbed and escaping moth or butterfly. </p>

<p>After a residence of two or three years in the country, Henry had
arrived at that age when he required and was likely to profit by more
profound instructions than he had hitherto received; with the view of
affording these, his family resumed their residence at Zurich, and he
was placed as a student in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Collegium Carolinum</i>, in which he was
matriculated, and finally took the degree of Master of Arts.</p>

<p>The secluded life which Fuseli's parents led, particularly while they
resided in the country, had confined his juvenile acquaintances to a M.
Nüscheler,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and to those youths who received occasional instructions
from his father in painting. A college was therefore a new and imposing
scene. Although he was then a novice in society, and had from nature a
degree of shyness, which was increased by seclusion; yet his acute and
discerning mind soon discovered those students who possessed the
greatest talents, and with whom <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
he could therefore with the more
pleasure associate. Accordingly, he formed an acquaintance, which
ripened into lasting friendship, with Lavater, Usteri, Tomman, Jacob,
and Felix Hess; names well known in German literature. </p>

<p>At this time, the celebrated Bodmer and Breitinger were professors in
the Caroline College; they were the intimate friends of the elder
Füessli, (who has transmitted their likenesses to posterity,) and in
consequence of this intimacy, they paid more than ordinary attention to
the young student. These learned men were, in addition to their other
studies, actively engaged in reforming the German language, and in this
respect correcting the taste of their countrymen, and they constantly
urged their pupils to pursue the same course; for at this period a pure
and elegant style was very rare, and therefore considered no mean
acquirement.</p>

<p>A naturally strong constitution, with considerable elasticity of mind,
enabled Fuseli to pursue his studies for many hours in each day without
interruption. In fact, he was capable of any mental labour, however
severe. He attended diligently the usual routine of college studies, and
being possessed of a very retentive memory, these were attained or
performed without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span> difficulty. He therefore found time to gain a
considerable knowledge of the English, French, and Italian languages. He
was attracted to these, not only by the desire of travelling at some
future period, but that he might be enabled to read some of the most
celebrated authors in their own tongues.</p>

<p>He was enamoured with the plays of Shakspeare, and attempted a
translation of Macbeth into German. The novels of Richardson,
particularly his Clarissa, made a powerful and lasting impression upon
his mind.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The works of Rousseau were eagerly devoured by him. And the
poetic flights of Dante not only aroused his feelings, but afforded
subjects for his daring pencil, which, notwithstanding his numerous
studies, was not laid aside. </p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Mixing in society naturally gives to an observing mind a knowledge of
men and manners. After Henry Fuseli had attended for some time the
college studies, and acquired some degree of confidence in his own
powers, he discovered and exposed weak points in some of the professors
and tutors who had been held up as examples to the students, and also
brought forward the merit and latent qualities of others, who from their
modesty had remained without notice, and thus drew them from obscurity.
If he could not attain his object by satire, in which he was very
powerful, he sometimes resorted to caricature, a weapon not less
formidable in his hands. The wounded pride of some of the masters
induced them to draw up a formal complaint against him, and he was
threatened with expulsion by the president, which was only a menace to
intimidate him, as the heads of the college admired his talents, and
were pleased with his assiduity.</p>

<p>In reading the Holy Scriptures (which he did diligently), the classics,
or the modern historians or poets, Fuseli's mind was most powerfully
attracted by those incidents or expressions which are out of the
ordinary course, and he frequently embodied them with his pencil. Bodmer
perceiving this bent of his mind, recommended him to try his powers in
poetry, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span> gave him, as models for imitation, the works of Klopstock
and Weiland. The former were considered by Henry to be master-pieces; he
caught the inspiration, and published, in a weekly journal called the
"<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Freymüthigen Nachrichten</span>,"<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> an ode to Meta. This was so much in the
spirit, and so near an imitation of Klopstock's style, that the ardent
admirers of this great poet attributed it to him, and which was believed
by all who were not in the secret. He also attempted a tragedy from the
Bible, "The Death of Saul," which was also highly commended. </p>

<p>It is but reasonable to suppose, that Bodmer would endeavour to instil
into the mind of a favourite pupil a love for the abstract sciences, in
the knowledge of which he was himself so eminently skilled: but for
these Fuseli showed an utter distaste, which continued during the whole
of his life. He has more than once exclaimed to me, "Were the angel
Gabriel sent expressly to teach me the mathematics, he would fail in his
mission." And he has frequently dilated upon the annoyance which he
felt, when discovered by any one of the tutors to be engaged in some
favourite pursuit, by his putting, in Latin, an abrupt and unexpected
question in physics, such as,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quid est calor, Henrice Füessli?</i>"</p>

<p>In the year 1761, Fuseli and his intimate friend Lavater entered into
holy orders. The state of pulpit oratory, at this time, in Zurich, is
thus described by a kinsman<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> of the former: "The Dutch method of
analyzing was at this time in vogue in our pulpits. By aiming at
popularity, the language was often reduced to the lowest strain, and to
mere puerilities. The subjects were chiefly dogmatical; and if a moral
theme was introduced, their sermons betrayed no knowledge of mankind:
they were mostly common-place declamation, deficient in precision and
just discrimination. Exaggeration prevented the backslider from applying
the description to himself; and as the way to reformation was neither
intelligibly nor mildly pointed out, he was rather irritated than
corrected. </p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"Even the most distinguished preachers lost themselves in long and
tiresome discourses, wandering either through the barren fields of
scholastic or academic exercises, of little interest to a common
audience; or else they spun out labyrinthine allegories.</p>

<p>"Others tried to excite the feelings by doctrines that bordered on
mysticism or Moravianism; and there were those who made simplicity their
aim, not the noble but the coarser species, descending to vulgarity and
meanness to flatter the popular taste, and endeavouring to disguise
vacuity and sameness by low comparisons, little tales, and awkward
imagery.</p>

<p>"Some were to be found who, in their zeal for doctrinal faith, abused
morality and philosophy, and bestowed the nickname of "<i>Taste-tellers</i>"
on those who took a different course, and aimed at a better mode of
address."</p>

<p>Klopstock, Bodmer, Weiland, Zimmerman, S. Gessner, and some others,
feeling how defective pulpit oratory was at Zurich, had laboured to
bring about a better style of preaching, but without much effect.
Fuseli, upon entering into holy orders, determined to regulate his
efforts, and by the advice of these learned men, he chose Saurin's
sermons as models of manner and arrangement; but with the view of
conveying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span> his sentiments so as to produce the greatest effect upon his
audience, adopted the more inflated language of Klopstock and of Bodmer.</p>

<p>As his reputation stood high at college, and as his society was coveted
for the power which he displayed in conversation, and for his deep
knowledge in the classics and in sacred and profane history; so, a great
degree of curiosity was excited among his friends, as to the success of
his probationary sermon, which he knowing, with characteristic humour,
took his text from the 17th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, 18th
verse, "What will this babbler say?" and preached against the passion of
curiosity.</p>

<p>The new mode of preaching which Fuseli adopted and carried into many of
the pulpits of Zurich; the novelty of the style, the originality of the
ideas, and the nervous language which he used, pleased "the judicious
few;" but it was "caviare to the general;" and hence the youthful
preacher gained no great degree of popular applause. His friends, and
Bodmer in particular, prompted him to persevere in the course which he
had commenced, assuring him, that, in the end, it would be crowned with
success; but at this time an incident happened, which gave a turn to his
pursuits in life.</p>

<p>The works of Rousseau, Voltaire, and others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span> who were then endeavouring
by their writings to bring about a reform in the political and moral
conditions of society, warmed his imagination, and he, Lavater, Jacob
and Felix Hess, (who were not less influenced,) were determined to exert
themselves, to benefit those of their native city. An opportunity was
soon presented to their active minds. Rumour had been for some time busy
with the character of a ruling magistrate, the high land-bailiff Grebel,
ascribing to him various acts of tyranny and oppression, and among
others, that of appropriating to himself property, and bidding defiance
to the rightful owners. This he considered he might do with impunity,
not only by the power which he possessed from his high situation, but
also from that which he derived from his father-in-law, who was the
burgomaster of Zurich.</p>

<p>The young friends made diligent inquiries into these charges, and found
that there were ample grounds to justify the reports which were current.
Their indignation was aroused, and they sent an anonymous letter to the
magistrate, threatening him with instant exposure if he did not restore
the property. Grebel, relying too much upon the feeling of security
which power creates, took no notice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span> of this letter. Upon which Fuseli,
and Lavater in particular, excited farther by his contempt, resolved to
make the cause of the injured party their own, and accordingly wrote a
pamphlet, entitled, "The Unjust Magistrate, or the Complaint of a
Patriot," in which they detailed, in forcible and glowing terms, the
acts of oppression which had been committed, and called upon the
Government to examine into the facts, and punish the offender.</p>

<p>This pamphlet they industriously circulated, and took care that it
should fall into the hands of all the principal members of the
government. The manly tone in which it was written, and the facts
adduced in support of the accusation, made such an impression on the
council of Zurich, that it was stated from authority, if the author
would avow himself, all the circumstances should be inquired into, and
the facts carefully examined.</p>

<p>Upon this, Fuseli and Lavater, who were the ostensible persons, boldly
stepped forward, and acknowledged themselves the authors. Evidence was
taken, and the truth of the accusation established to its utmost extent.
An upright judgment was awarded; the property restored; and the guilty
magistrate then absconded, to avoid the personal punishment so justly
due to his crimes.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Of this incident, which perhaps was the most important of Fuseli's life,
as it was the cause of his quitting his native country, and changing his
profession, he very seldom spoke; and during the whole term of our
acquaintance, never mentioned the particulars but once, and then
remarked, "Although I cannot but reflect with some degree of
satisfaction upon the correctness of our feeling, and the courage which
we displayed, yet, situated as we and our families then were, it evinced
precipitation on our part, and a want of knowledge of the world."</p>

<p class="bgft">This spirited act, on the part of Fuseli and his friends, was for some
time the theme of public conversation at Zurich, and their patriotism
was greatly applauded. But the disgrace which had fallen, by their
means, on the accused, was felt by his powerful family, who considered,
that, from their connexion with him, a part of the ignominy fell upon
themselves. The tendency and natural consequences of such feelings were
properly appreciated by the respective families of the young men, and
they considered it prudent to recommend them to withdraw for a time from
the city.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">It</span> was fortunate for Fuseli and his friends, that the learned Sulzer,
who held the situation of professor of mathematics in the Joachimsthel
College, at Berlin, was at Zurich at this time, having obtained leave
from the King of Prussia to visit his native country, to endeavour to
dissipate his grief for the loss of a beloved wife. Sulzer, who had
taken a lively interest in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span> cause which these young men had
advocated, was about to return to Berlin, and offered to take them with
him: this opportunity was not to be neglected; and he, Fuseli, Lavater,
Jacob and Felix Hess, set out on their journey, early in the year 1763,
accompanied by a numerous train of friends and admirers, who attended
them as far as Winterthur, at which place they were welcomed with
fervour, as the enemies of oppression.</p>

<p>Sulzer justly and properly appreciated what would probably be felt by
young men who, for the first time, leave home and those connexions which
make home dear to them; and he therefore, in order to dissipate any
unpleasant feelings, determined to remain for some days at those cities
or towns on the road, where there was any thing to be seen worthy of
attention. The change, however, was less felt by Fuseli than by his
companions; the profession in which he had been employed was not one of
his choice; he had always entertained a strong desire to travel, and he
had lost, a few years previously, an affectionate mother<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> to whom he
was tenderly attached. </p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>The first city of note at which they tarried was Augsburgh: here Fuseli
showed his predilection for art, in giving, by letter to his friends at
Zurich, a florid description of the sensations which he experienced on
seeing the colossal figure of St. Michael over the gateway of the
arsenal, the work of a Bavarian sculptor, Reichel. In the churches and
senate-house of this city, the paintings of Tintoretto, Schönfeld, and
Rothenhamer, attracted his particular attention; and he expressed his
regret at the neglect which appeared to attend the works of the
last-named master, (whom he eulogizes as "one of the most able painters
of Germany,") as his pictures were then falling into rapid decay.</p>

<p>At Leipsic, they were introduced by Sulzer to Ernesti, Gellert, Weisse,
and other literati. From the description which Fuseli gave of the two
former, it is evident that he, as well as Lavater, had paid early in
life a sedulous attention to physiognomy. Of Ernesti, he says, "although
he spoke of the liberality of all classes in Saxony, his countenance did
not agree with his words; on the contrary, he seems to be growing
intolerant from knowledge and from authorship." Of Gellert, he remarks,
"he has an expressive mouth, it turns on one side with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span> a sensible easy
smile; he is so gentle, so accustomed to express simplicity in his very
countenance, and yet so quick-sighted, that he was disturbed by being
looked at, and inquired whether I was displeased with him; he has
certainly a tendency to hypochondria."</p>

<p>On their arrival at Berlin, Sulzer commenced (according to a promise
made at Zurich) arrangements for publishing a splendid and improved
edition of his friend Bodmer's "Noachide," which was to be embellished
with engravings. B. Rhode, of Berlin, was employed to make the designs
for the first four cantos; those for the remaining eight were furnished
by Fuseli, who, not only to raise his own credit, but to show his
gratitude to Bodmer, exerted his utmost ability upon that work.
Comparing these with his former drawings, it is evident that the St.
Michael, at Augsburgh, was the standard for the stupendous forms which
he introduced against a murky sky, in the terrible scenes of the
destruction of the primeval inhabitants of the earth. In these subjects
he succeeded beyond expectation. In the more lovely scenes of the poem
he was not equally happy; for, "instead of repose and cheerfulness, his
female figures had a degree of wantonness bordering somewhat upon
voluptuousness."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>The popularity of the cause which induced Fuseli and his companions to
leave Zurich travelled before them, and they were caressed not only by
the friends and acquaintances of Sulzer, at Berlin, but by all those who
were enemies to oppression from whatever quarter it might spring. Among
these, was the then Baron Arnheim, who was so much pleased with the
recital of the transaction, and struck with the appearance and
conversation of Fuseli and Lavater, that he had a picture painted,
representing their first interview, which is still preserved by his
family.</p>

<p>After remaining a short time at Berlin, Sulzer placed his young friends
with Professor Spalding, who resided at Barth, in Hither Pomerania.
Fuseli here pursued his classical studies with eagerness, and did not
neglect the fine arts, for we find that he drew the portrait of the
Professor's daughter, and also added to the decorations of her
summer-house by his pencil.</p>

<p>During a residence of six months at Barth, he gained the highest
estimation for talents with all those who knew him, and the esteem of
Spalding, but he left his friends there, being recalled to Berlin by
Sulzer.</p>

<p>The cause of Fuseli's return to the capital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span> was, that, at this time,
some of the literati of Germany and Switzerland had it in contemplation
to establish a regular channel of literary communication between those
countries and England. Fuseli's tutors and friends, Bodmer, Breitenger,
and Sulzer, felt a lively interest in this project, and took an active
part in carrying the design into execution. These philosophers thought,
that there was no person better qualified than Fuseli to conduct the
business. He was possessed of great mental and bodily activity; they had
the highest opinion of his talents; and they considered that his
extensive knowledge of modern languages would facilitate their project.
In making the proposal, Sulzer represented that it would be
inconvenient, if not dangerous, for him to go back, within a limited
time, to Zurich; for it was well known to the family of Grebel, that he
had taken the most active part in the affair against their relation: and
moreover that, although his companions might, under this circumstance,
from their powerful connexions, return at no distant period with
impunity, yet Fuseli, not so happily situated, would suffer from all the
effects of tyranny which power could exercise. This reasoning had its
due effect upon the mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span> of Fuseli; he however asked the opinion of his
father, which being in favour of his accepting the offer of Sulzer, made
him determine to visit England.</p>

<p>Sir Andrew Mitchell was at this time the British minister at the court
of Prussia: he was a friend of Sulzer's, who accordingly introduced
Fuseli to him. At his house he improved much in English conversation,
and he met several men of literary note, among whom was Dr. Armstrong,
who was then physician to the British forces in Germany; and with this
gentleman he became intimately acquainted.</p>

<p>Sir Andrew Mitchell was about to return to England; and being pleased
with the society of Fuseli, and wishing to give every facility to the
views of Sulzer, he liberally made the offer to the latter that his
young friend should accompany him to London, and promised that he would
give him his protection when there, and such introductions as should be
useful in effecting the object of his mission. This offer was not to be
refused: Fuseli, therefore, set out with Sir Andrew, and arrived in
England at the close of the year 1763.</p>

<p>Before he quitted Prussia, he took leave of Lavater, his early and
devoted friend, who, at parting, put into his hands a paper, which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
previously had framed and glazed, on which was written, in German,
"<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Thue den siebenden theil von dem was du thun kannst</span>."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> "Hang this in
your bed-chamber, my dear friend," said he; "look at it occasionally,
and I foresee the result."</p>

<p>Sir Andrew Mitchell fully performed his promise, for, on their arrival
in London, he was anxious to introduce his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</i> to men distinguished
either for rank, property, or talents: among these were the late Lord
Scarsdale and Mr. Coutts, the banker. Sir Andrew, knowing, however, that
booksellers of respectability and probity are the best patrons of
literary characters, strongly recommended him to Mr. Andrew Millar and
Mr. Joseph Johnson. The former was well known as an opulent man, and an
old and established publisher; the latter had but recently begun
business on his own account, but he had already acquired the character
which he retained during life,&mdash;that of a man of great integrity, an
encourager of literary men as far as his means extended, and an
excellent judge of their productions. With these persons Fuseli kept up
a friendly intercourse during their lives. </p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Fuseli took lodgings in the house of a Mrs. Green, in Cranbourn Street,
then called Cranbourn Alley. He lived here from prudential
motives,&mdash;those of economy, as well as being near to the house of a
gentleman (Mr. Coutts) to whom he had been introduced, who resided at
this time in St. Martin's Lane. No sooner was he fixed in this place,
than he wrote to his father, to give him an account of his voyage and
journey from Berlin to London, and of the prospects which appeared to be
open to him. Stranger as he was in the great metropolis of England,
separated from his family, and nearly unknown to any of its inhabitants,
his sensitive feelings were aroused, and in a gloomy state of mind he
sallied forth, with the letter in his hand, in search of a post-office.</p>

<p>At this period there was much greater brutality of demeanour exercised
by the lower orders of the English towards foreigners than there is at
present. Meeting with a vulgar fellow, Fuseli inquired his way to the
post-office, in a broad German pronunciation: this produced only a
horse-laugh from the man. The forlorn situation in which he was placed
burst on his mind;&mdash;he stamped with his foot, while tears trickled down
his cheeks. A gentleman who saw the transaction, and felt for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span> Fuseli,
apologised for the rudeness which he had received, explained its cause,
and told him that, as a foreigner, he must expect to be so treated by
the lower orders of the people: after this he shewed him where he might
deposit his letter. This kindness from a stranger, in some degree,
restored tranquillity to his agonised feelings.</p>

<p>Finding that his name was difficult of pronunciation to an Englishman,
he shortly after altered the arrangement of the letters, and signed
"Fusseli."</p>

<p>He kept up a constant correspondence with Bodmer and Sulzer. This was
not, however, conducted in those terms of respectful diffidence in which
a pupil generally addresses his tutors; but with that manly independence
of spirit which he inherited from his father, and with that originality
of thought so peculiar to himself; which, although he frequently
differed in opinion with them, and expressed his notions with asperity,
was somewhat pleasing to these eminent men, particularly to Bodmer,
whose constant advice to his pupils was, "Think and act for yourselves."</p>

<p>The independent spirit of Fuseli would not allow him to be under the
pecuniary obligations which his friends offered; he therefore laboured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
hard, and fortunately got ample employment from the booksellers, in
translating works from the French, Italian, and German languages into
English; and some popular works from the English into German,&mdash;among
others the letters of Lady Mary Wortley Montague.</p>

<p>In 1765, he published (with his name affixed) a translation of the Abbé
Winkelmann's "Reflections on the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks,"
which was dedicated to his friend and patron, Lord Scarsdale. The
dedication is dated the 10th April, 1765. Much to the credit of Mr.
Millar, he took every opportunity of forwarding the sale of this work,
and gave Fuseli the whole proceeds, after deducting only the expenses of
paper and printing.</p>

<p>At this time he visited very frequently Smollet, and also Falconer, the
author of "the Shipwreck," and other works. The latter then was allowed
to occupy apartments in old Somerset House, and Fuseli always
represented him as a man of mild and inoffensive manners, although far
from being happy, in consequence of the pressure of his pecuniary
circumstances. For Doctor Smollet he made several drawings of scenes in
his novel of Peregrine Pickle, which were engraved and published in an
early edition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span> of that well-known work. This edition is now very scarce.</p>

<p>Mr. Cadell having, in the year 1766, succeeded to the business of Mr.
Millar, as a bookseller and publisher, he also kept up the connexion
with Fuseli, and gave him constant employment.</p>

<p>A taste for the fine arts had been recently awakened in England, and
some of the principal painters, sculptors, and architects, had formed
themselves into a society for promoting them; from which circumstance,
high expectations were raised of the encouragement likely to be afforded
to artists by the public. Fuseli was stimulated by these to fresh
exertions of his pencil, and all his leisure hours were devoted to
drawing or etching historical subjects.</p>

<p>About this period he became acquainted with two artists his countrymen,
Mr. Moser, who on the establishment of the Royal Academy was appointed
Keeper, and Mr. Kauffman, chiefly known, at present, as the father of
the more celebrated Angelica Kauffman, who, considered as a female
artist, even now ranks high as an historical painter.</p>

<p>With Miss Kauffman, it appears, Fuseli was much enamoured; and although
he did not at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span> any time hold her professional talents in high esteem,
yet he always spoke of her in terms of regard, and considered her as a
handsome, lively, and engaging woman.</p>

<p>The youth, fine manly countenance and conversational talents of Fuseli
made a deep impression upon most female hearts and minds: hence, Miss
Mary Moser (now better known as Mrs. Lloyd), the daughter of Mr. Moser,
who was in almost the daily habit of seeing and conversing with him,
also experienced their influence; and she flattered herself that the
feelings which she had were mutual.</p>

<p>If Fuseli ever had any affection for this lady while he was in England,
it was soon dissipated by change of scene and the pleasures which he
pursued when in Italy. The two following letters, which are extracted
from Mr. J. T. Smith's Life of Nollekens, tend to show the disposition
of both parties towards each other.</p>

<p class="blockquot"><br />"<span class="smcap">If</span> you have not forgotten at Rome those friends whom you
remembered at Florence, write to me from that nursery of arts
and raree-show of the world, which flourishes in ruins: tell me
of pictures, palaces, people, lakes, woods, and rivers; say if
Old Tiber droops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span> with age, or whether his waters flow as clear,
his rushes grow as green, and his swans look as white, as those
of Father Thames; or write me your own thoughts and reflections,
which will be more acceptable than any description of any thing
Greece and Rome have done these two thousand years.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"I suppose there has been a million of letters sent to Italy
with an account of our Exhibition, so it will be only telling
you what you know already, to say that Reynolds was like himself
in pictures which you have seen; Gainsborough beyond himself in
a portrait of a gentleman in a Vandyke habit; and Zoffany
superior to every body, in a portrait of Garrick in the
character of Abel Drugger, with two other figures, Subtle and
Face. Sir Joshua agreed to give a hundred guineas for the
picture; Lord Carlisle half an hour after offered Reynolds
twenty to part with it, which the Knight generously refused,
resigned his intended purchase to the Lord, and the emolument to
his brother artist. (He is a gentleman!) Angelica made a very
great addition to the show; and Mr. Hamilton's picture of
Brisëis parting from Achilles, was very much admired; the
Brisëis in taste, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à l'antique</i>, elegant and simple. Coates,
Dance, Wilson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span> &amp;c. as usual. Mr. West had no large picture
finished. You will doubtless imagine, that I derived my
epistolary genius from my nurse; but when you are tired of my
gossiping, you may burn the letter, so I shall go on. Some of
the literati of the Royal Academy were very much disappointed,
as they could not obtain diplomas; but the Secretary, who is
above trifles, has since made a very flattering compliment to
the Academy in the Preface to his Travels: the Professor of
History is comforted by the success of his "Deserted Village,"
which is a very pretty poem, and has lately put himself under
the conduct of Mrs. Hornick and her fair daughters, and is gone
to France; and Dr. Johnson sips his tea, and cares not for the
vanity of the world. Sir Joshua, a few days ago, entertained the
Council and Visitors with calipash and calipee, except poor
Coates, who last week fell a sacrifice to the corroding power of
soap-lees, which he hoped would have cured him of the stone:
many a tear will drop on his grave, as he is not more lamented
as an artist than a friend to the distressed. (<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ma poca polvere

<p class="p2">Mrs. Lloyd was a painter of flowers, which she grouped with taste, and
coloured with truth and brilliancy; in this department of the art she
experienced patronage from her late Majesty Queen Charlotte, who
employed her pencil not only on pictures, but also to decorate a room in
the palace at Frogmore. This lady always held the talents of Fuseli in
the highest respect. Being invited by the late Mr. Angerstein to view
the superb collection of pictures in his house in Pall Mall, then
belonging to him, but subsequently sold by his heirs to the Nation, she
left him by expressing her gratitude for the treat which his kindness
had afforded her, but she added, "In my opinion, Sir, your finest
pictures are on the staircase," alluding to those which he purchased of
Fuseli,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span> and which had formed a part of the Milton Gallery.</p>

<p>At this time, Garrick was in the height of his reputation; and as Fuseli
considered the theatre the best school for a foreigner to acquire the
pronunciation of the English language, and Garrick's performance an
excellent imitation of the passions, which would give him a lesson
essential to historical designs; he never missed the opportunity of
seeing him act, and he was generally to be found in the front row of the
pit: to obtain which, he often used much personal exertion, and put
himself in situations of hazard and inconvenience. And he has often
dwelt with delight upon the performances of the man who represented so
well the stormy passions of Richard, or the easy libertinism of Ranger;
and then could descend to the credulous Abel Drugger, and, in the
character of the silly tobacconist, so alter the expression of his
countenance as scarcely to be recognised as the person who had
delineated the higher character in the histrionic art. As a proof of the
strong impression which Garrick's acting made at this period upon
Fuseli, there are now in the possession of the Countess of Guilford, two
drawings, which he presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> to the late Alderman Cadell; the one
representing Garrick and Mrs. Pritchard as Macbeth and Lady Macbeth,
from the passage,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"I have done the deed;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>the other, Garrick as Richard the Third, making love to Lady Anne, over
the corse of her father-in-law, Henry the Sixth. These, according to an
inscription on the second, were made in London, in 1766. And although
they have the faults of most of his early productions, yet they are
drawn with characteristic truth and spirit.</p>

<p>At the end of the year (1766) an advantageous offer was made to Fuseli,
to undertake the situation of travelling tutor to Viscount Chewton, the
eldest son of Earl Waldegrave, which, after consulting Professor Sulzer,
he accepted. For this charge, it was considered, his extensive knowledge
of languages and eminent literary talents fully qualified him. His
lordship was young, and, when in France, showed an impatience of control
common to a youth of his age and rank in life, the latter of which he
thought should exempt him from the authority and constraint which his
tutor considered it his duty to exert. This disposition, on the part of
the pupil, naturally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span> excited the irritable feelings of Fuseli, and on a
second refusal to obey, a severe blow was given. Considering that, after
this, his services would be of no avail to a youth by whom they were not
properly appreciated, he, to use his own words, "determining to be a
bear-leader no longer," wrote in nearly those terms to Earl Waldegrave,
and returned to England. He left, however, some written instructions
with Lord Chewton, showing how he might profit by travelling. On his
return to this country, Earl Waldegrave, so far from condemning (as
Fuseli expected) his conduct, told him that he had acted with a proper
degree of spirit; but Fuseli's family, and most of his friends, blamed
him in the strongest terms for his impetuosity, as they considered that
a want of forbearance on his part had ruined those prospects in life
which naturally would arise from forming a connexion with a family of
such consequence as that of Earl Waldegrave. To Bodmer he explained all
the circumstances of the case, with the state of his feelings; and his
venerable tutor wrote him a letter of consolation. In reply to this,
Fuseli spoke in florid terms of the agonies which he had felt while
residing in that noble family, when he considered himself obliged to say
Yes, when No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span> "stuck in the throat;"&mdash;and thus showed, that he was not
framed to live with courtiers. In after-life he used to remark jocosely
to his friends, "The noble family of Waldegrave took me for a
bear-leader, but they found me the bear."</p>

<p>On Fuseli's return to England, in 1767, there was every prospect that
the society which had been formed for the promotion of the fine arts
would receive royal protection and patronage, and become a chartered
body.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> And it was then the general opinion, that great public
encouragement would be given to artists. This still increased his wish
to become a painter. He sought for and obtained an introduction to Mr.
(afterwards Sir Joshua) Reynolds, to whom he showed a portfolio of
drawings, and some small etchings, which he had recently made from
subjects in the Bible, and an etching on a large scale from
Plutarch,&mdash;"Dion seeing a female spectre sweep his hall." Sir Joshua,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
who was much struck with the style, grandeur, and original conception of
his works, asked him how long he had been from Italy? Fuseli answered,
"he had never seen that favoured country;" at which the former expressed
much surprise; and, to mark how highly he estimated his talents,
requested permission to have some of the drawings copied for himself.
This was readily granted, and he was induced, by the solicitations of
Fuseli, to accept some of the etchings. The interview ended by Reynolds
assuring him, that "were he at his age, and endowed with the ability of
producing such works, if any one were to offer him an estate of a
thousand pounds a-year, on condition of being any thing but a painter,
he would, without the least hesitation, reject the offer."</p>

<p>Having received such encouragement and flattering encomiums from the
greatest painter of the age, Fuseli directed nearly the whole of his
attention to drawing; and at the recommendation of Reynolds, afterwards
tried oil colours. The first picture he produced was "Joseph
interpreting the dreams of the butler and baker of Pharaoh." On showing
this to Reynolds, he encouraged him to proceed, remarking, "that he
might, if he would, be a colourist as well as a draughtsman." This
picture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span> now in the possession of the Countess of Guilford, fully
justifies the opinion of Sir Joshua, as it is remarkably well coloured,
and, as a first attempt in oil colours, may be considered a surprising
production.</p>

<p>From the time of Fuseli's first arrival in England, he had been a
constant visitor at Mr. Johnson's house, and, in common with all those
who were acquainted with him, was a great admirer of his steady, upright
character. In the summer of 1767, he was prevailed upon to accompany him
to Liverpool, which was Johnson's native town. From this, and subsequent
visits, Fuseli became acquainted with men who, in after-life, were the
greatest patrons of his pencil.</p>

<p class="bgft">The attention of the public was at this time much engaged by the
constant attacks made by Hume and Voltaire on the works of Rousseau.
Fuseli advocated the cause of his countryman, and published anonymously,
during the year 1767, a thin duodecimo volume, entitled "Remarks on the
Writings and Conduct of J. J. Rousseau." But he never wished it to be
considered that he was the author of this work. To speak of it as a
literary production, it abounds with wit and sarcasm; and although, in
style, it cannot be considered strictly English, yet there is novelty in
the remarks, and great power of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span> language throughout the book. It also
shows him to be well read in the works of Rousseau, whom at this time he
idolized, and to be perfectly acquainted with the nature of the disputes
in all their bearings. Perhaps the reasons for not wishing it to be
considered a work of his, although he never denied it, were, that there
are in several instances coarseness of language and indelicacies of
expression which disfigure the pages of the book, and that in more
advanced life the high opinion which he had formed of Rousseau, was in a
degree abated. Fuseli gave the design for the frontispiece, which
represents in the foreground, Voltaire booted and spurred, riding upon
man, who is crawling upon the earth: in the back of the picture, Justice
and Liberty are gibbeted. Rousseau is witnessing Voltaire's pranks, and
by his attitude seems to threaten disclosure. This work is rarely to be
met with, as the greater part of the impression was destroyed shortly
after it was printed, by an accidental fire which took place in Mr.
Johnson's house, who then resided in Paternoster Row.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Fuseli</span> had now determined to relinquish the pen for the pencil, and to
devote his life to painting; his wishes were therefore directed to Rome,
the seat of the fine arts.</p>

<p>Having at Mr. Coutts' table renewed the intimacy with Dr. Armstrong,
which formerly subsisted at Berlin, and as the Doctor considered it
necessary to pass the winter in the milder climate of Italy, to relieve
a catarrhal complaint, under which he was then labouring, Fuseli was
tempted to accompany him thither, and they left London the end of
November 1769, with the intention of going to Leghorn by sea.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Their voyage, from adverse winds and tempestuous weather, was long and
tedious; the monotony of a life at sea, and the qualms which generally
affect landsmen in such a situation, were not fitted to allay the
naturally irritable tempers of Armstrong and his companion: they at
first became dissatisfied with their situation, then with each other,
and finally quarrelled about the pronunciation of an English word;
Fuseli pertinaciously maintaining that a Swiss had as great a right to
judge of the correct pronunciation of English as a Scotsman.</p>

<p>After a tedious passage of twenty-eight days, the ship was driven by a
gale of wind into Genoa, where Fuseli and Armstrong parted in a mood far
from friendly. Armstrong took the direct road to Florence, where he
intended to reside. Fuseli went first to Milan; here he remained a few
days to examine the works of art, and then passed a short time at
Florence, on his way to Rome, where he arrived on the 9th of February
1770.</p>

<p>Shortly after he had taken up his abode in "the eternal city," he again
changed the spelling of his name; this he did to accommodate it to the
Italian pronunciation; and always afterwards signed, "<i>Fuseli</i>."</p>

<p>His views now were to see the stores of art, which had been collected
in, or executed at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span> Rome; and subsequently, to examine with care each
particular specimen, for his future improvement. He did not spend his
time in measuring the proportion of the several antique statues, or in
copying the fresco or oil pictures of the great masters of modern times;
but in studying intensely the principles upon which they had worked, in
order to infuse some of their power and spirit into his own productions.</p>

<p>Although he paid minute attention to the works of Raphael, Correggio,
Titian, and the other great men whom Italy has produced, yet, he
considered the antique and Michael Angelo as his masters, and formed his
style upon their principles.</p>

<p>To augment his knowledge, he examined living models, sometimes attended
the schools of anatomy, and used the dissecting knife, in order to trace
the origin and insertion of the outer layer of muscles of the human
body. But he was always averse to dissecting, believing the current
story, that his idol, Michael Angelo, had nearly lost his life from a
fever got by an anatomical examination of a human body in a state of
putrefaction.</p>

<p>By such well-directed studies, and by great exertion, his improvement
was rapid, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span> soon acquired a boldness and grandeur of drawing
which surprised the Italian artists, one of whom was so struck with some
of his compositions, that, in reference to their invention, he
immediately exclaimed, "Michael Angelo has come again!"</p>

<p>In the year 1772, his progress was impeded by a fever, which enfeebled
his nervous system. This illness he attributed to the heat of the
climate, and to having, in a degree, departed from those regular and
very abstemious habits which marked the early part of his life. The
fever changed his hair, originally of a flaxen, to a perfectly white
colour, and caused a tremulous motion in the hands, which never left
him, but increased with age. He has more than once told me, that this
indisposition drove his mind into that state, which Armstrong so
forcibly describes in "The Art of preserving Health:"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">"Such a dastardly despair<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Unmans your soul, as madd'ning Pentheus felt,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">When, baited round Cithæron's cruel sides,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">He saw two suns, and double Thebes ascend."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Being advised to change the air and scene, he went to Venice, and
remained there until he had thoroughly examined the works of art in that
city, and regained sufficient strength of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span> body and mind to resume with
effect his studies and labours at Rome.</p>

<p>Although he got much employment from those Englishmen who resided at or
visited Rome, yet he saved no money, being always negligent of pecuniary
concerns. His friends in England were unacquainted with his progress in
the arts until the year 1774, when he sent a drawing to the exhibition
of the Royal Academy, the subject of which was, "The death of Cardinal
Beaufort," from Shakspeare.</p>

<p>In 1775, he visited Naples, studied the works of art in that city, and
examined the excavations at Herculaneum and Pompeii.</p>

<p>In 1777, he sent from Rome to England a picture in oil, representing a
scene in "Macbeth," for the annual exhibition at the Royal Academy.</p>

<p>In 1778, he took a farewell of Rome, and left his friends there with
regret. As a nation, however, he was not very partial to the modern
Italians, who, he said, "were lively and entertaining, but there was the
slight drawback of never feeling one's life safe in their presence."
This he exemplified by the following fact: "When I was one day preparing
to draw from a woman selected by artists for a model, on account of her
fine figure, on altering the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span> arrangement of her dress, I saw the hilt
of a dagger in her bosom, and on inquiring, with astonishment, what it
meant, she drew it, and quaintly answered, '<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Contro gl' impertinenti</span>.'"</p>

<p>On his way to Switzerland, he stayed some time at Bologna, Parma,
Mantua, Milan, Lugano, and Belanzona. At Bologna, he remained with Sir
Robert Smyth, Bart. who, while at Rome, had given him considerable
employment. Thence he proceeded to Lugano, from which place he wrote the
following letter to Mr. Northcote, who was then studying at Rome:&mdash;</p>

<p class="inright"><br />
"Lugano, 29th Sept. 1778.</p>
<p class="blockquot">

<p class="blockquot">"<span class="smcap">You</span> may, and must think it unfriendly for me to have advanced
to the borders of Switzerland without writing to you; but what
would have been friendly to you was death to me; and
self-preservation is the first duty of the eighteenth century.
Madness lies on the road I must think over to come at you; and
at the sound of Rome, my heart swells, my eye kindles, and
frenzy seizes me.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"I have lived at Bologna as agreeably and as happily as my
lacerated heart and boiling brains would let me, with Sir Robert
and his lady.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">"You, whose eye diverges not, will make the use of Bologna I
have not, or at least but very imperfectly: much more than what
is thought of, may be made of that place. What I admire, and
what I frequented most,&mdash;what indeed suited my melancholy best,
are the cloisters of St. Michael, in Bosco, near the city. The
fragments of painting there are by Ludovico Caracci and his
school, and, in my opinion, superior for realities to the
Farnese gallery. There is a figure<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> in one of the pictures
which my soul has set her seal upon: 'tis to no purpose to tell
you what figure&mdash;if you find it not, or doubt, it was not
painted for you; and if you find it, you will be obliged for the
pleasure to yourself only. Still in that, and all I have seen
since my departure, Hesiod's paradox gains more and more ground
with me,&mdash;'that the half is fuller than the whole,' or, if you
will, full of the whole. </p>

<p class="blockquot">"At Mantua I have had emotions which I had not apprehended from

</p>

<p class="p2">In Italy he became acquainted with David and other artists of note, as
well as with several Englishmen distinguished either for rank or
talents. With the Hon. George Pitt (the late Lord Rivers,) he there
became very intimate, and he was flattered by his friendship and
patronage, which he enjoyed during the whole of his life. </p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>The necessary employment of his time in painting, and studying works of
art, during several of the first years of his residence in Italy, was
such as to leave little opportunity for other occupations, and he found,
to his regret, that he had either lost a great deal of his knowledge of
the Greek language, or, what is more probable, that he had never
possessed it in that degree which he flattered himself he had attained
while at college. Determined, however, to regain or acquire this, he now
studied sedulously the Grecian poets, made copious extracts of fine
passages from their works, and thus gained, in the opinion of the best
judges, what may be called, at least, a competent knowledge of that
language.</p>

<p>Although Fuseli's professional talents were much admired, and highly
appreciated in Italy, yet, as he did not court it, he never obtained a
diploma, or other honour, from any academy in those cities in which he
resided, or occasionally visited. Indeed, he refused all overtures which
were made to him on this subject; for he considered that the institution
of academies "were symptoms of art in distress."</p>

<p>Having arrived at Zurich the end of October 1778, after an absence of
sixteen years, his father, who had taken great pains, in early life, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
check his love for the fine arts, and to prevent his being an artist,
was now gratified by witnessing the great proficiency he had attained:
and he knew enough of the state of the arts in Europe to feel that his
son did then rank, or would shortly, among the first painters of his
time. During a residence of six months with his family, he painted some
pictures; among them "The Confederacy of the Founders of Helvetian
liberty," which he presented to, and which is still preserved in, the
Senate-house at Zurich. Lavater, however, did not consider this picture
a good specimen of his friend's powers, particularly as to colouring,
and expressed his distaste to this in such strong terms, as were by no
means gratifying to him.</p>

<p>Fuseli was always very susceptible of the passion of love. But when at
Zurich, in the year 1779, his affections were gained in an extraordinary
degree by the attractions of a young lady, then in her twenty-first
year, the daughter of a magistrate, who resided in the "Rech" house of
Zurich. This lady, whom he calls in his correspondence, "Nanna," had a
fine person, lively wit, and great accomplishments, and among the
latter, her proficiency in music was considerable, which is celebrated
in a poem by Göethe. It appears that she was not indifferent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span> to him;
but her father, who was opulent, considered that her marriage with a man
dependent upon the caprice of the public for his support, was not a
suitable connexion for his daughter, and he therefore withheld his
consent to their union. This disappointment drove Fuseli from Zurich
earlier than he intended; and it would appear by his letters, that his
mind, even after his arrival in England, was almost in a state of
phrenzy. He, some time after, however, received the intelligence that
"Nanna" had given her hand to a gentleman who had long solicited it,
Mons. le Consieller Schinz, the son of a brother of Madame Lavater; and
thus his hopes in that quarter terminated.</p>

<p class="bgft">In April 1779, he took a last farewell of his native country and family,
and returned to settle again in London. On his way to England, in order
to improve his knowledge in art, he travelled leisurely through France,
Holland, and the Low Countries, examining in his route whatever was
worthy of notice.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">When</span> Fuseli arrived in London, he took apartments in the house of an
artist, Mr. Cartwright, whom he had known at Rome. This Gentleman then
resided at No. 100, St. Martin's Lane, and practised chiefly as a
portrait painter; he sometimes attempted historical subjects, in which,
however, he did not excel. The kindness and simplicity of Mr.
Cartwright's disposition and manners were appreciated by Fuseli, who
afforded him many useful hints, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span> sometimes assistance, in his
professional pursuits. When we look at the historical pictures which he
painted, it is easy to perceive what figures owe their production to
Fuseli's mind; but it must be confessed that they appear to hang to the
subject</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Like a giant's robe upon a dwarfish thief."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When settled in London, his first object was to renew an acquaintance
with those whose friendship he had cultivated, and, as he considered,
secured before he went to Italy. On calling, for this purpose, upon Mr.
Coutts, that gentleman frankly said, he was not pleased with him for the
quarrel which he had with Dr. Armstrong while on board ship. Fuseli
attempted to remove the impression which had been made on Mr. Coutts'
mind; but that gentleman replied, "I consider that the age and talents
of the Doctor should have commanded a sufficient degree of respect from
you, to have prevented any rudeness on your part; and I am very sorry to
tell you, that he is now labouring under a severe, and what is
considered an incurable malady." This account disarmed Fuseli, who had
always entertained a high opinion of the talents of Armstrong, and
considered his poems, particularly that on "The Art of preserving
Health," productions of great merit. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>He therefore determined to
suppress every hostile feeling, and to call upon the Doctor without
delay.</p>

<p>On sending up his name, he was admitted almost immediately into
Armstrong's bed-chamber. The poet, however, could not restrain his
naturally sarcastic humour, and the following dialogue took
place:&mdash;Armstrong: "So, you have come back?" Fuseli: "Yes; I have come
home." Armstrong: "Come, you mean, to London! 'the needy villain's
gen'ral home;' however," (putting out his hand) "I thank you for this
visit: you find me in bad plight; but I am glad to see you again." After
this salutation they conversed amicably; but the Doctor did not long
survive the interview.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>About this time, the intimacy between Fuseli and Professor Bonnycastle
commenced, which was kept up during their lives. The introduction took
place at Mr. Johnson's house. Fuseli's voice being heard as he ascended
the staircase, Mr. Johnson said to Bonnycastle, "I will now introduce
you to a most ingenious foreigner, whom I think you will like; but, if
you wish to enjoy his conversation, you will not attempt to stop the
torrent of his words by contradicting him." </p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>The genius and acquirements of Fuseli soon attracted the notice of men
who were distinguished for learning and talents, and more especially
those who possessed also a taste for the fine arts; among whom may be
particularly noticed Lord Orford, and Mr. Lock of Norbury Park, with
whom, and with his eldest son in particular, he kept up a constant
friendly intercourse. Fuseli not only regarded Mr. William Lock junior,
for the amiability of his character and his extensive knowledge, but
also for his taste and critical judgment in the fine arts, as well as
for the power which he displays in historical painting, whenever he
condescends to employ his pencil thereon. In this particular, he
considered that Mr. W. Lock ranked as high, or higher, than any historic
painter in England. The society at the house of Mr. Lock was well chosen
and very select; and here he occasionally met Sir Joshua Reynolds and
Dr. Moore, author of Zeluco and other popular works. Dr. Moore being
highly entertained with his conversation, took an early opportunity of
introducing him to his family, with the whole of whom Fuseli kept up the
most uninterrupted intercourse and friendship during life.</p>

<p>I may, I hope, here be allowed to digress by stating, that after the
marriage of Mr. James<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span> Carrick Moore and that of his brother, Admiral
Sir Graham Moore, Fuseli in a manner became domesticated in their
respective families. In their houses he was always a welcome and
highly-favoured guest: there he was unrestrained; and his wit and gibes
were allowed to sally forth sometimes upon contemporary artists, and
often upon popular men, or passing events. The freedom which he enjoyed
in their society, encouraged him to give utterance to the wild and
unpremeditated flights of his fancy. It was with these favoured friends
that he displayed the depth of his learning, his fine taste in poetry,
and critical judgment in painting. By their indulgence, his intemperate
expressions usually passed unnoticed, and the ebullitions of a naturally
impatient temper were soothed.</p>

<p>Gratitude makes me acknowledge the uniform kindness which I have also
experienced from Mr. Carrick Moore and his family; and that I am
indebted to them for much valuable assistance in compiling the
particulars of Fuseli's life, and for some of those characteristic
anecdotes and reminiscences which will be found in the sequel. Fuseli
has more than once said to me, after we had partaken of their
hospitality, "Moore's is the most pleasant house to visit that I know,"
and coupled the observation with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span> such encomiums on the sound sense,
knowledge, and accomplishments of that family, (known certainly to those
who have the pleasure of their acquaintance,) which, if repeated in this
place, might be considered by some as flattery on my part.</p>

<p>When Fuseli returned to England, Sir Joshua Reynolds was in the zenith
of popularity as a portrait painter; but his powers in historical
painting were not then sufficiently appreciated: hence, some of his best
works remained on his hands until his death; for example, the "Dido,"
the series of designs for the painted window at Oxford, the "Cymon and
Iphigenia," and several others. West, as an historical painter, was
held, at this time, in equal, if not in higher esteem by the public,
than Sir Joshua. Fuseli was astonished at this, and accordingly was not
backward in expressing his opinion thereon, both in writing and in
conversation, for he was at no time of his life an admirer of West. He
however always gave to him the merit of much skill in composing;&mdash;of a
thorough knowledge of the art which he professed, and a perfect mastery
over the materials which he employed; and he spoke in terms of qualified
praise of his pictures of "Regulus,"&mdash;"Death of Wolfe," and "Paul
shaking the viper from his hand."&mdash;But he considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span> that West was
wanting in those qualities of the art which give value to historical
design,&mdash;invention, and boldness of drawing; and being determined to
show what he could do in these particulars, in 1780, Fuseli exhibited at
the Royal Academy the following pictures:</p>

<p>"Ezzlin musing over Meduna, slain by him, for disloyalty, during his
absence in the Holy Land."&mdash;"Satan starting from the touch of Ithuriel's
lance."&mdash;"Jason appearing before Pelias, to whom the sight of a man with
a single sandal had been predicted fatal."</p>

<p>These paintings raised him, in the opinion of the best judges, to the
highest rank in the art; and the President, Sir Joshua Reynolds,
considered that they possessed so much merit, that he had them placed in
prominent situations in the Exhibition.</p>

<p>The following anecdote has been told of Fuseli, with regard to West,
which is certainly characteristic of the man, and if true, shows his
feelings towards that painter in a very pointed manner. At the election
of West to the chair of the Royal Academy, in the year 1803, after a
secession of twelve months, the votes for his return to the office of
President were unanimous, except one, which was in favour of Mrs. Lloyd,
then an academician. Fuseli was taxed by some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span> of the members with
having given this vote, and answered, "Well, suppose I did, she is
eligible to the office&mdash;and is not one old woman as good as another?"</p>

<p>The next year, 1781, he painted his most popular picture, "The
Nightmare," which was considered to be unequalled for originality of
conception. The drawing first made, which is now in my possession, had
the words, "St. Martin's Lane, March 1781," written by him in the
margin; it is a masterly performance, chiefly in black chalk, and is
composed without the head of the mare. This subsequent thought is added
in the picture, which, when placed in the annual exhibition of 1782,
excited, as it naturally would, an uncommon degree of interest. This
picture was sold by him for twenty guineas; it was subsequently engraved
by Burke, and published by J. R. Smith; and so popular was the subject,
that the publisher acknowledged to have gained upwards of five hundred
pounds by the sale of the prints, although vended at a small price.</p>

<p>The conception of the subject of "The Nightmare" has been thus
beautifully described by one of the most popular poets of his time,&mdash;Dr.
Darwin.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">"So on his <span class="smcap">Nightmare</span>, through the evening fog,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Flits the squab fiend o'er fen, and lake, and bog;<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Alights, and grinning sits upon her breast&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Such as of late, amid the murky sky,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">While with quick sighs and suffocative breath,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Fuseli painted at different periods several pictures of "the Nightmare:"
but in each of them there are variations from, or additions to, the
first drawing of that subject. His fame was about this time further
raised by two pictures, "The Weird Sisters," and "Lady Macbeth walking
in her sleep," of which excellent prints in mezzotinto were made; these
also became popular, and tended to advance the merit of the artist in
the opinion of connoisseurs.</p>

<p>In 1781, he received intelligence of the death of his father,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> who
was esteemed both as a writer and a painter, and had not only acquired a
name for his talents, but for the assistance which he was at all times
ready to give in furtherance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span> of literature and the fine arts. At his
decease, he had arrived at the advanced age of seventy-five years.
Fuseli this year painted a picture, representing an interview, which
took place in 1778, between him and his aged tutor, Bodmer. In
this, Fuseli is sitting in an attitude of great attention, and Bodmer
apparently speaking: the subject of the conversation may be supposed to
relate to philosophy or literature, from the bust of a sage which is
placed upon the mantel of the room. This picture he sent to Zurich, as a
present to Solomon Escher, a friend of his, and a near relation of
Bodmer. About this period, in paying a visit to Lord Orford, with whom
he kept up the most familiar intercourse, he had the misfortune to fall
from a horse, and, among other injuries which he received dislocated his
shoulder.</p>

<p>In 1785, he again visited Liverpool, having received an invitation from
Mr. Roscoe,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span> acquaintance he had made shortly after his return
to this country from Italy. This visit cemented that friendship which
remained unabated during his life. Of the virtues and talents of this
friend, Fuseli always spoke in the highest terms of praise. Mr. Roscoe,
who saw Fuseli's works with the eye of a poet, as well as with that of a
connoisseur, patronized him, not only by giving him commissions at
different times to paint ten pictures for himself, but by recommending
his works to his numerous friends.</p>

<p>In January 1786, Cowper issued a prospectus for publishing a translation
of Homer into English blank verse. To give the public some notion of his
powers, and ability to execute the task, he sent to Mr. Johnson, his
publisher, a manuscript translation of 107 lines of the 24th book of the
Iliad, being part of the interview of Priam and Achilles, and also
proposals for publishing the work by subscription. This specimen was
shown to Fuseli, who, without hesitation, made several alterations in
it, which appeared to Mr. Johnson to be so judicious, that he sent it
back to Cowper for his opinion before the manuscript was printed,
without, however, mentioning the name of the critic. Cowper immediately
saw that these alterations were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span> improvements, and had been made by a
scholar and a man of taste; and expressed his readiness, not only to
adopt them, but to attend to any suggestions, if the same person would
overlook his translation. Fuseli readily agreed to do this, without the
notion of any reward; and he accordingly made observations on the
translation of the Iliad, and alterations therein, before the several
books passed through the press.</p>

<p>Hayley, in his Life of Cowper, and the latter in the preface to his
translation of Homer, and also in his published letters, have given many
testimonials of their opinion of Fuseli, not only as a Greek scholar,
but for his taste and judgment in English poetry. The former (Hayley)
remarks, "It is a singular spectacle for those who love to contemplate
the progress of social arts, to observe a foreigner, who has raised
himself to high rank in the arduous profession of a painter, correcting,
and thanked for correcting, the chief poet of England, in his English
version of Homer."</p>

<p>The following letters, hitherto unpublished, which I have obtained
through the kindness of Mr. Hunter, one of the executors to the will of
the late Mr. Johnson, are additional evidence how highly Cowper
estimated the assistance which he received from Fuseli.</p>

<p class="insmall">"Mr. Joseph Johnson."
</p>

<p class="p2">Fuseli grew tired of the labour which he had imposed upon himself,
before the Iliad was finished; but yet he went through the task of
correcting the translation of that poem until its conclusion. The
following extract of a letter to Mr. Roscoe, dated 25th November, 1789,
shows his feelings upon the subject:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are not surely serious when you desire to have your remarks on
Cowper's Iliad burnt; whatever they contain upon the specific turn of
language is just; many observations are acute, most elegant: though,
perhaps, I cannot agree to all; for instance, the word rendered murky is
not that which, in other passages, expresses the negative transparency
of water: it means, I believe, in the text,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span> a misty appearance: this
depended on a knowledge of the Greek.</p>

<p>"I heartily wish with you, that Cowper had trusted to his own legs,
instead of a pair of stilts, to lift him to fame."</p>

<p>When Cowper began the Odyssey, Fuseli pleaded, and, as will be shown,
justly pleaded, that his numerous avocations would not allow him time to
correct the translation; this the poet states, and regrets the
circumstance in his preface. He however saw parts of the poem as it was
passing through the press, and made some observations thereon: these are
given in notes, to which the initial letter F. is affixed.</p>

<p>It is a singular fact that Fuseli never saw Cowper, nor did he ever
write to him or receive a letter from him; all communications being
carried on either through General Cowper, the relation of the poet, or
Mr. Joseph Johnson.</p>

<p>The late Doctor Geddes frequently visited at Mr. Johnson's, and often
met Fuseli there; both, from their natural temperament, were impatient
of contradiction, and each had an opinion of his own powers, and
depreciated those of the other. It was only to meet in order to dispute,
and the ready wit of Fuseli usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span> raised the irritable temper of the
doctor, who, when provoked, would burst out of the room and walk once or
twice round St. Paul's Churchyard before he returned to the company; to
the great amusement of Fuseli. One day he indulged himself at Johnson's
table, to plague Geddes with uttering a string of truisms: Geddes at
length became impatient, and said, "I wonder that you, Mr. Fuseli, who
have so much ready wit, should be uttering dogmas by the hour together."
Fuseli immediately answered, "You, Doctor, to find fault with
dogmas,&mdash;you, who are the son of a dog&mdash;ma." The pause between the
syllables instantly raised a tumult in the doctor's mind, and he
replied, "Son of a b&mdash;&mdash;h I suppose you mean;" and, as usual, left the
room to cool himself by his accustomed round.</p>

<p>Dr. Geddes had a great love for horticultural pursuits. Dilating one day
on the evils of fanaticism, Fuseli stopped him, by, "You, Doctor, to
speak against fanaticism, when you are a fanatic."&mdash;"In what?" asked
Geddes impatiently.&mdash;"In raising cucumbers," said the other.</p>

<p>When Cowper's translation of Homer appeared, Geddes, who was a great
admirer of Pope, was irritated beyond measure at the work, but chiefly
by the praises bestowed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span> the preface upon Fuseli; and he had not
sufficient prudence even to hide what he felt, but a detail of this will
be given best in the words of his intimate friend, admirer, and
biographer, the late Doctor I. Mason Good.</p>

<p>"Pope was the idol of Geddes, and estimated by him as highly above
Cowper, as Cowper was above his contemporaries: and he could not but
look with a jealous eye upon any one who attempted to rival the poet of
his heart. Geddes was disgusted with Cowper from the very first page,
and in a fit of undue exasperation declared he would translate Homer
himself, and show that it was possible to make as good versification,
while he preserved not only all the epithets and phraseologies of the
original, which Mr. Cowper has not done, but the very order itself. Yet
what appears principally to have irritated him, was Mr. Cowper's
declaration, towards the close of his preface, of acknowledgments 'to
the learned and ingenious Mr. Fuseli,' whom he styles in the same place
'the best critic in Homer I have ever met with.'</p>

<p>"Accident had frequently thrown Dr. Geddes and Mr. Fuseli into the same
company, and much learned dust had as frequently been excited between
the two critical combatants, not at all times to the amusement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span> of the
rest of the respective parties. Whatever opinion Mr. Fuseli may have
entertained of the powers of his antagonist, it is certain that Doctor
Geddes was not very deeply impressed with those of Mr. Fuseli, and that
he scarcely allowed him the merit to which he is actually entitled.
When, therefore, he found in Mr. Cowper's preface, that instead of
consulting the profound erudition and sterling authorities of Stephens,
Clarke, Ernesti, and Velloison, he had turned to Mr. Fuseli as his only
oracle, and had gloried in submitting to the whole of his corrections
and emendations: to his disappointment at the inadequacy of the version,
was added a contempt of the quarter to which he had fled for assistance.</p>

<p class="bgft">"Geddes resolved to translate Homer, and in the beginning of 1792,
published a translation of the first book as a specimen. In the preface
he says, 'I beg leave to assure my readers that neither <i>Fuseli nor any
other profound critic</i> in Homer, has given me the smallest assistance;
the whole merit or demerit of my version rests solely with myself.' The
attempt failed, and he never succeeded beyond the first book."</p>

<h2><br /><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="blockquot">Subjects painted by Fuseli for Boydell's "Shakspeare
Gallery."&mdash;His assistance towards the splendid Edition of
"Lavater's Physiognomy."&mdash;His picture for Macklin's "Poets'
Gallery."&mdash;His contributions to the Analytical Review.&mdash;His
critique on Cowper's Homer. </p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the year 1786, Mr. Alderman Boydell, at the suggestion of Mr. George
Nicol, began to form his splendid collection of modern historical
pictures, the subjects being from Shakspeare's plays, and which was
called "The Shakspeare Gallery." This liberal and well-timed speculation
gave great energy to this branch of the art, as well as employment to
many of our best artists and engravers, and among the former, to Fuseli,
who executed eight large and one small picture for the gallery. The
following were the subjects:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Prospero, Miranda, Caliban, and Ariel&mdash;from the Tempest. Titania in
raptures with Bottom, who wears the ass's head, attendant fairies, &amp;c.
Titania awaking, discovers Oberon at her side; Puck is removing the
ass's head from Bottom&mdash;Midsummer Night's Dream. Henry the Vth with the
Conspirators&mdash;King Henry V. Lear dismissing Cordelia from his
Court&mdash;King Lear. Ghost of Hamlet's Father&mdash;Hamlet. Falstaff and
Doll&mdash;King Henry IV. 2d part. Macbeth meeting the Witches on the
Heath&mdash;Macbeth. Robin Goodfellow&mdash;Midsummer Night's Dream.&mdash;This gallery
gave the public an opportunity of judging of Fuseli's versatile powers.</p>

<p>The stately majesty of the ghost of Hamlet's father, contrasted with the
expressive energy of his son, and the sublimity brought about by the
light, shadow, and general tone, strike the mind with awe. In the
picture of Lear is admirably pourtrayed the stubborn rashness of the
father, the filial piety of the discarded daughter, and the wicked
determination of Regan and Goneril. The fairy scenes in the Midsummer
Night's Dream amuse the fancy, and show the vast inventive powers of the
painter: and Falstaff with Doll is exquisitely ludicrous.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>The example set by Boydell was a stimulus to other speculations of a
similar nature, and within a few years appeared the Macklin and
Woodmason galleries; and it may be said with great truth, that Fuseli's
pictures were among the most striking, if not the best in either
collection.</p>

<p>The splendid edition of Lavater's physiognomy was announced this year
(1786) for publication. Fuseli wrote the preface, or, as he modestly
called it, the "advertisement;" corrected the translation by Hunter;
made several drawings to illustrate the work; and superintended the
execution of the engravings. Lavater had prepared many of his drawings,
illustrative of the system, on a folio size, wishing the treatise to be
brought out in that form; and it was his desire, that his lines should
be rather traced than imitated by the engraver. Fuseli entered into an
animated correspondence on this subject; gave him to understand, that
the quarto size best pleased the British public; and expressed his own
decided opinion against "ponderous folios." He at length succeeded in
getting Lavater's slow consent to the work appearing in quarto; but so
particular was the author as to a proper exemplification, that he made
his drawings anew to suit the quarto size.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1787, he painted a picture for Macklin's Poet's Gallery, "the Vision
of Prince Arthur."</p>

<p>In May 1788, the Analytical Review was commenced by Mr. Johnson, and he
entered into engagements with most of the authors whose works he
published, to write criticisms for it. Fuseli, of course, was among the
number; and he wrote, during the progress of that work, which continued
until December 1798, upwards of eighty articles, some of which were long
and laboured criticisms, while others were only brief notices of the
contents of the books. As his knowledge was general and extensive, so he
was employed in several departments of literature, and reviewed works on
the classics, history, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belles lettres</i>, physiology, geography, and
the fine arts. Fuseli not only took an interest in his own criticisms in
this Review, but frequently defended those of others. When the
authenticity of the Parian Chronicle was doubted by the Rev. Joseph
Robertson, in a work which he published, it was reviewed and confuted by
the Rev. John Hewlett. Robertson replied to this very angrily; and on
Mr. Hewlett's being urged, in the hearing of Fuseli, not to let this
reply pass without observation, he immediately said, "Answer it! no, by
G&mdash;d,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span> the subject is as dead as hell: a lion does not feed upon
carrion."</p>

<p>The following criticisms on "Cowper's Homer," and "Roscoe's Lorenzo de'
Medici," will give some idea of his powers in this department of
literature.</p>

<h4><br />COWPER'S HOMER.</h4>

<p class="blockquot">Translators of poetry may be arranged into two classes: those
who, without invention, but an ardent ambition for its honours,
with powers of embellishment, harmony of diction, and elegance
of taste, attempt to graft their own scions on a solid stem; and
those who, from real or imagined sympathy with the production of
another, unable to perceive excellence through any other medium
but that of their idol, renounce all individual consequence,
swear to his words, and rank themselves under his banner. The
first sacrifice their model to themselves and their age; the
second sacrifice both to their darling original. Of both kinds
of translation, the muses of this country have produced
specimens: Mr. Pope ranks foremost in the former; whether that
of Mr. Cowper claims the same eminence in the latter class, we
are now to inquire.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Though the ultimate end of poetry be to please, and the best
include both instruction and pleasure at once, it will easily be
perceived that the laws which are to rule two species of
translation so different, cannot be the same. The laws which the
first imposes, are of its own creation and choice; the laws of
the second resemble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span> somewhat those which a master prescribes to
his servant;&mdash;they have little to gratify vanity, they are
related to resignation,&mdash;they are fidelity and simplicity, with
as much harmony and vivacity as is compatible with both; for the
translator of Homer, indeed, the difficulty will not be&mdash;how
much he shall sacrifice of these two last requisites, but how
much he shall be able to obtain, or to preserve.</p>

<p class="blockquot">By <i>fidelity</i>, some will understand the mere substitution of one
language for another, with the entire sacrifice of idiom and
metre, which belongs only to the literal translation of
school-books. Fidelity, as Mr. C. himself has with equal
happiness and precision defined it in his preface, is that
quality which neither omits nor adds any thing to an author's
stock. "I have invented nothing,' says he; "I have omitted
nothing." When we consider the magnificent end of epic
poetry,&mdash;to write for all times and all races,&mdash;to treat of what
will always exist and always be understood, the puny laws of
local decorum and fluctuating fashions by which the omission or
modification of certain habits and customs, natural but
obsolete, is prescribed, cannot come into consideration. Such
laws may bind the meaner race of writers. He who translates
Homer knows, that when Patroclus administers at table, or
Achilles slays the sheep himself for Priam, a chief and a prince
honour the chieftains and king who visit them, and disdain to
leave to meaner hands these pledges of hospitality; and he
translates faithfully and minutely, nor fears that any will
sneer at such a custom, but those who sneer at the principle
that established it. He neither "attempts to soften or refine
away" the energy of passages relative to the theology of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
primitive ages, or fraught with allegoric images of the
phenomena of nature, though they might provoke the smile of the
effeminate, and of the sophists of his day. This is the first
and most essential part of the fidelity prescribed to a
translator; and this Mr. C. has so far scrupulously observed,
that he must be allowed to have given us more of Homer, and
added less of his own, than all his predecessors; and this he
has done with that simplicity, that purity of manner, which we
consider as the second requisite of translation.</p>

<p class="blockquot">By <i>simplicity</i>, we mean, what flows from the heart; and there
is no instance of any translator known to us, who has so
entirely transfused the primitive spirit of an ancient work into
a modern language; whose own individual habits and bent, if we
may be allowed the expression, seem to be so totally
annihilated, or to have coalesced so imperceptibly with his
model. He is so lost in the contemplation of his author's
narrative, that, in reading, we no more think of <i>him</i> than we
do of Homer, when he hurls us along by the torrent of his plan:
no quaintness, no antithesis, no epigrammatic flourish, beckons
our attention from its track, bids us admire or rather
indignantly spurn the intruding dexterity of the writer. To have
leisure to think of the author when we read, or of the artist
when we behold, proves that the work of either is of an inferior
class: we have neither time to inquire after Homer's birth-place
or rank, when Andromache departs from her husband, nor stoop to
look for the inscription of the artist's name, when we stand
before the Apollo.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Considering next the <i>harmony</i> of numbers prescribed to the
translator of a poet, Mr. C. himself allows that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span> he has many a
line 'with an ugly hitch in its gait;' and perhaps to those he
acknowledges as such, and the copious list of others called
forth in battle array against him, no trifling file of equally
feeble, harsh, or halting ones might be added. Still we do not
hesitate to give it as our opinion, founded on a careful perusal
of the whole, that the style and the flow of his numbers are in
general consonance with the spirit of the poem. In particular
lines, he may be inferior to many; we even venture to say, that
he has as often adopted or imitated the discords of Milton, as
his flow of verse. The English Jupiter perhaps shakes his
ambrosial curls not with the full majesty of the Greek; the
plaintive tones of Andromache do not perhaps melt, or the
reverberated bursts of Hector's voice break, on our ear with
their native melody or strength; the stone of modern Sisyphus
oppresses not with equal weight, or rebounds with equal rapidity
as that of old; the hoarseness of Northern language bound in
pebbly monosyllables, and almost always destitute of decided
quantities, must frequently baffle the most vigorous attempt, if
even no allowance were made for the terror that invests a
celebrated passage, and dashes the courage of the translator
with anxiety and fear. Still, if Mr. C. be not always equally
successful in the detail, his work possesses that harmony which
consists in the variety of well-poised periods,&mdash;periods that
may be pursued without satiety, and dismiss the ear uncloyed by
that monotony which attends the roundest and most fortunate
rhyme, the rhyme of Dryden himself.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The chief trespass of our translator's style,&mdash;and it will be
found to imply a trespass against his fidelity and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
simplicity,&mdash;is no doubt the intemperate use of inversion,
ungraceful in itself, contrary to the idiom of his language,
and, what is still worse, subversive of perspicuity, than which
no quality distinguishes Homer more from all other writers: for
Homer, though fraught with every element of wisdom, even in the
opinion of a critic<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> to no heresy more adverse than that of
acknowledging faultless merit, whether ancient or
modern,&mdash;Homer, with all this fund of useful doctrine, remains
to this day the most perspicuous of poets, the writer least
perplexed with ambiguity of style. His tale is so clearly told,
that even now, as of yore, he is or may be the companion of
every age, and almost every capacity, at almost every hour. This
perspicuity is perhaps not to be attained by the scantiness of
modern grammar; it is perhaps not to be fully expected from the
inferior powers of the most attentive translator, wearied with
labour, and fancying that to be clear to others which is
luminous to him: but this we cannot allow to be pleaded every
where in excuse of our translator's ambiguities, after the ample
testimony he bore in his preface to the perspicuity of his
author. Such palliation, indeed, will not be offered by him who
tells us, that not one line before us escaped his attention. We
decline entering into particulars on this head, partly because
Mr. C. cannot be ignorant of the passages alluded to, partly
because sufficient, and even exuberant, pains have been taken by

<p class="blockquot">But if the translator often deviate from his model in so
essential a requisite, he scrupulously adheres to another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span> of
much less consequence,&mdash;the observance of those customary
epithets with which Homer distinguishes his gods and heroes from
each other. As most of these are frequently no more than
harmonious expletives of the verse, often serve only as a
ceremonious introduction to his speakers, we are of opinion,
that he might at least have sometimes varied them with advantage
to his verse, and for the greater gratification of his reader.
He who thought it a venial licence to deviate in the first line
of his work from the text, who cries&mdash;'woe to the land of
dwarfs,'<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>&mdash;who makes his hero often 'the swiftest of the
swift,' tinges the locks of Menelaus with 'amber,' and varies
Eumæus from plain swineherd to 'the illustrious steward or noble
pastor of the sties,' he surely might have saved us from the
'archer-god,' 'the cloud-assembler Jove,' the 'city-spoiler
chief,' the 'cloud-assembler deity,' &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. or, in mercy to
our debauched ears, have meditated combinations more consonant
to verse and language. Their casual omission would not have
proved a greater infidelity than that which made him disregard
names and epithets, expressly repeated in the original, of which
that of Asius the Hyrtacide in the catalogue<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> is a striking
instance.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Homer is ample, and the translator studies to be so, and
generally with success; but Homer is likewise concise, where Mr.
C. is often verbose, and where, by more careful meditation, or
more frequent turning of line and period, he might have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
approached his master. Homer finishes; but, like Nature, without
losing the whole in the parts. The observations which the
translator offers on this in the Preface we are tempted to
transcribe. Pref. p. xv.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The passages which will be least noticed, and possibly not at
all, except by those who shall wish to find me at a fault, are
those which have cost me abundantly the most labour. It is
difficult to kill a sheep with dignity in a modern language, to
flay and to prepare it for the table, detailing every
circumstance of the process. Difficult also, without sinking
below the level of poetry, to harness mules to a waggon,
particularizing every article of their furniture, straps, rings,
staples, and even the tying of the knots that kept all together.
Homer, who writes always to the eye, with all his sublimity and
grandeur, has the minuteness of a Flemish painter."</p>

<p class="blockquot">To this remark, founded on truth, we could have wished Mr. C.
had added the reason why Homer contrived to be minute without
being tedious,&mdash;to appear finished without growing languid,&mdash;to
accumulate details without losing the whole; defects which have
invariably attended the descriptions of his finished followers,
from Virgil and Apollonius, down to Ariosto, and from him to the
poets of our days, Milton alone excepted. It is, because he
never suffered the descriptions that branched out of his subject
to become too heavy for the trunk that supported them; because
he never admitted any image calculated to reflect more honour on
his knowledge than on his judgment; because he did not seek,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
but find, not serve, but rule detail, absorbed by his great end;
and chiefly, because he, and he alone, contrived to create the
image he described, limb by limb, part by part, before our eyes,
connecting it with his plot, and making it the offspring of
action and time, the two great mediums of poetry. The chariot of
Juno is to be described:<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> it is not brought forth as from a
repository, tamely to wait before the celestial portico, and
subjected to finical examination, the action all the while
dormant: on the spur of the moment, Hebe is ordered to put its
various parts together before our eyes; the goddess arranges her
coursers, mounts, shakes the golden reins, and flies off with
Minerva, and our anticipating expectation, to the battle.
Agamemnon is to appear in panoply:<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> we are not introduced to
enumerate greaves, helmet, sword, belt, corslet, spear; they
become important by the action only that applies them to the
hero's limbs. We are admitted to the toilet of Juno:<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> no idle
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">étalage</i> of ornaments ready laid out, of boxes, capsules, and
cosmetics; the ringlets rise under her fingers, the pendants
wave in her ears, the zone embraces her breast, perfumes rise in
clouds round her body, her vest is animated with charms.
Achilles is to be the great object of our attention: his shield
a wonder:<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> heaven, earth, sea, gods, and men, are to occupy
its orb; yet, even here he deviates not from his great rule, we
see its august texture rise beneath the hammer of Vulcan, and
the action proceeds with the strokes of the celestial artist.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Where description must have stagnated or suspended action, it is
confined to a word, 'the sable ship,' 'the hollow ship;' or
despatched with a compound, 'the red-prowed ship,' 'the
shadow-stretching spear.' If the instrument be too important to
be passed over lightly, he, with a dexterity next to miraculous,
makes it contribute to raise the character of the owner. The bow
of Pandarus is traced<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> to the enormous horns of the mountain
ram, and its acquisition proves the sly intrepidity of the
archer, who bends it now. The sceptre of Agamemnon<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> becomes
the pedigree of its wearer: it is the elaborate work of Vulcan
for Jupiter, his gift to Hermes, his present to Pelops, the
inheritance of Atreus, the shepherd-staff of Thyestes, the badge
of command for Agamemnon. Thus Homer describes; this is the
mystery, without which the most exquisite description becomes an
excrescence, and only clogs and wearies the indignant and
disappointed reader. Poetic imitation, we repeat it, is
progressive, and less occupied with the <i>surface</i> of the object
than its <i>action</i>; hence all comparisons between the poet's and
the painter's manners, ought to be made with an eye to the
respective end and limits of either art: nor can these
observations be deemed superfluous, except by those who are most
in want of them, the descriptive tribe, who imagine they paint
what they only perplex, and fondly dream of enriching the realms
of fancy by silly excursions into the province of the florist,
chemist, or painter of still life. </p>

contrast, may enable him to estimate the variety of our author's
powers, to poise his blemishes and beauties, and to form an idea
of what he is to expect from a perusal of the whole. To exhibit
only the splendid, would have been insidious; it would have been
unfair to expose languor alone;&mdash;we have pursued a middle
course; and when he has consulted the volumes themselves, the
reader, we trust, will pronounce us equally impartial to the
author and himself.</p>

</div></div>

<p class="blockquot">If translation be chiefly written for those who cannot read the
original, it is, we apprehend, self-evident, that Polypheme's
charging <i>Outis</i> with an attempt on his life, and the departure
of his associates in consequence of this information, must
remain a problem to those who do not understand the Greek. To
them, <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Outis</i> is the name of somebody, and why that should pacify
the giants who came to assist the Cyclops, appears
unsatisfactory, if not inconceivable. Clarke, when he adduces
the passage from the Acta Eruditorum, which censures Gyphanius
for having translated <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Outis</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nemo</i>, would have done well if he
had adduced other reasons in support of his opinion (if indeed
he coincided in opinion with that passage) than grammatical
futilities. The separation of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#959;&#965;-&#948;&#949;</span> can be no reason why the
brethren of Polypheme should depart; his destruction remained a
call equally urgent for their assistance, whether it was
carrying on by fraud or force. In Homer, whenever a man is asked
after his name, he replies, they call me so,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span> or my mother has
given me such a name; and this is always in the accusative.
Ulysses, to deceive Polypheme, consults probability, and the
customary reply to a question after a name, and therefore calls
him <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Outin</i>, not <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Outina</i>, to escape the suspicion of the Cyclops;
but well surmised, or Homer at least for him, that his enemy
would pronounce his name in the nominative, if he should be
asked who was his destroyer. If the deception be puerile, it is
to be considered, that no sense can be obtained without it; and
on whom is it practised? on something worse than a solitary
barbarian not trained up in social craft; it is exerted on a
monster of mixed nature, unacquainted with other ideas than the
immediate ones of self-preservation, brutal force, and greedy
appetite. The whole fiction is indeed one of those which
Longinus calls dreams, but the dreams of Jupiter; and the
improbabilities of the component parts vanish in the pathos, and
the restless anguish of curiosity which overwhelms us in the
conduct of the tale.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> </p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">That the translation of the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#922;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#965;&#962;</span>, in the celebrated
passage of Sisyphus, should have met with indulgence from those
who insist on the preservation of <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Outis</i>, may not be matter of
surprise, because, as Mr. C. observes, 'it is now perhaps
impossible to ascertain with precision what Homer meant by the
word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#954;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#965;&#962;</span>, which he only uses here and in the next book,
where it is the name of Scylla's dam.' We give it up too, though
not willingly, because the ancients appear to have been as
ignorant of the being so called as ourselves; some of whom, by
cutting the word into two, attempted to make it rather an
attribute of the stone itself, than the effect of some external
power: but from <i>him</i>, we are more surprised at the observation
on the word '<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#953;&#948;&#951;&#962;</span>,' in the same passage, as 'also of very
doubtful explication.' Is it not the constant practice of Homer
to diffuse energy by animating the inanimate? has he forgotten
the maddening lances, the greedy arrows, the roaring shores, the
groaning earth, the winged words, the cruel brass, and a
thousand other metaphors from life? and if these occurred not to
his memory, the observation of <i>Aristotle</i> on the passage in
question, as quoted by Clarke, might have removed all doubts
about the true sense of the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#953;&#948;&#951;&#962;</span>, when applied to a
rock.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Mr. Cowper, in his interpretation of many words and expressions
of dubious explication, has generally chosen that sense which
seemed most to contribute to the perspicuity of the passage:
thus in Iliad, iv. v. 306, seq. when Nestor instructs his troops
before the battle, he has, in our opinion, adopted the best and
only sense, though rejected by Clarke, with more subtilty than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
reason. Thus he has substituted the word 'monster' for the
epithet <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#7936;&#956;&#945;&#953;&#956;&#945;&#954;&#949;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span>, Iliad, xvi. 329, with sufficient propriety,
whether that word be expressive of enormity of dimension, or
untameableness of disposition; in both which senses it occurs in
Pindar.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> We might enlarge on the terms <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#7936;&#956;&#951;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#967;&#953;&#964;&#969;&#957;&#945;&#962;</span>; <span

variety of others equally disputed or obscure; but as they will
be sufficiently recognized by the scholar, whilst the unlearned
reader is enabled to pass smoothly over them, we shall just
observe, that the interpretation of the proverbial passage in

mentions Megara as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span> daughter of Creon, and one of the women

together. </p>

<p class="blockquot">But enough. Of similar observations, perhaps more might be
added. These at least will show the attention with which we have
compared copy and original. If, among the emendations of a
future edition, they be not passed over as cavils, or treated as
nugatory, our purpose will be fully answered. It would be
difficult to determine in which of the two poems Mr. C. has
succeeded best. We however incline to decide in favour of the
Odyssey. The prevalent mixture of social intercourse, domestic
manners, and rural images, with the scenes of terror and
sublimity, as upon the whole it renders that poem more pleasing,
though not more interesting than the Iliad, and what we would
call a poem for all hours, appears to us to have been more
adapted to the mild tones of our translator, than the
uninterrupted sublimity and pathos of the Iliad. In parting from
both, we congratulate the author on the production, and the
public on the acquisition of so much excellence. We contemplate
the whole in its mass as an immense fabric reared for some noble
purpose: on too near an approach, not perhaps of equal beauty,
with parts left rough that might have been smoothed to neatness,
and others only neat that might have been polished into
elegance; blemishes that vanish at a proper distance: by uniform
grandeur of style, the whole strikes with awe and delight,
attracts now the eyes of the race who saw it rise, and, secure
of duration from the firmness of its base and the solidity of
its materials, will command the admiration of posterity.<br /><br /></p>

Fine Arts, exemplified in his Criticism on Roscoe's Lorenzo de'

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> following review of Roscoe's Lorenzo de' Medici, will shew Fuseli's
critical knowledge of Italian history.</p>

<h4><br />ROSCOE'S LORENZO DE MEDICI.</h4>

<p class="blockquot">"The close of the fifteenth, (says Mr. R. Pref. p. i.) and the
beginning of the sixteenth century, comprehend one of those
periods of history which are entitled to our minutest study and
enquiry. Almost all the great events from which Europe derives
its present advantages are to be traced up to those times. The
invention of the art of printing, the discovery of the great
Western Continent, the schism from the Church of Rome, which
ended in the reformation of many of its abuses, and established
the precedent of reform; the degree of perfection attained in
the fine arts, compose such an illustrious assemblage of
luminous points, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>as cannot fail of attracting for ages the
curiosity and admiration of mankind.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"A complete history of these times has long been a great
desideratum in literature; and whoever considers the magnitude
of the undertaking will not think it likely to be soon supplied.
Indeed, from the nature of the transactions that then took
place, they can only be exhibited in detail, and under separate
and particular views. That the author of the following pages has
frequently turned his eye towards this interesting period is
true; but he has felt himself rather dazzled than informed by
the survey. A mind of greater compass, and the possession of
uninterrupted leisure, would be requisite to comprehend, to
select, and to arrange the immense varieties of circumstances
which a full narrative of those times would involve, when almost
every city of Italy was a new Athens, and that favoured country
could boast its historians, its poets, its orators, and its
artists, who may contend with the great names of antiquity for
the palm of mental excellence: when Venice, Milan, Rome,
Florence, Bologna, Ferrara, and several other places, vied with
each other, not in arms, but in science and in genius, and the
splendour of a court was estimated by the number and talents of
learned men, who illustrated it by their presence, each of whose
lives and productions would, in a work of this nature, merit a
full and separate discussion."</p>

<p class="blockquot">"From this full blaze of talents, the author has turned towards
a period when its first faint gleams afford a subject, if not
more interesting, at least more suitable to his powers; when,
after a night of unexpected darkness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span> Florence again saw the
sun break forth with a lustre more permanent, though perhaps not
so bright. The days of Dante, Boccaccio, and of Petrarch, were
indeed past; but under the auspices of the House of Medici, and
particularly through the ardour and example of Lorenzo, the
empire of science and taste was again restored."</p>

<p class="blockquot">Having thus, with great modesty, stated the motives for his
choice of subject, the author presents us with a rapid sketch of
the Medician family, the literary and political character of
Lorenzo, and his undeserved fate as statesman and writer in the
succeeding century: he then proceeds to a critical enumeration
of the narratives composed of his life, from the contemporary
one of Niccolo Valori to the recent volumes of Fabroni, the mass
of whose valuable documents, together with the communications of
a learned friend, admitted to the printed and manuscript
treasure of the Laurentian library, and the acquisition of a
number of scarce tracts, procured from the sales of the Crevenna
and Pinelli books, arranged and concentrated by indefatigable
assiduity, he considers as the basis on which he was enabled to
erect his own system, and to fill up the chasm that had hitherto
separated from legitimate history, the period elapsed between
the last stage of decay and final dissolution of the Byzantine
empire by Mahommed II. and the brilliant epoch that rose with
the accession of Charles the Fifth to the German throne.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The first chapter opens with Florence, its origin, its
tempestuous though not improsperous liberty during the political
schism of its citizens into the two factions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span> of Ghibelines and
Guelphs, or Bianchi and Neri, subsiding at length under the
levelling preponderance of the Medicean family, whose annals our
author traces from the real or romantic date of Charlemagne to
the accession of Cosmo, emphatically decorated with the
appellation of <i>Pater Patriæ</i>, and the height of its commercial
and political influence.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'The authority,' observes our author, p. 13, 'which Cosmo and
his descendants exercised in Florence during the fifteenth
century, was of a very peculiar nature; and consisted rather in
a tacit influence on their part, and a voluntary acquiescence on
that of the people, than in any prescribed or definite compact
between them. The form of government was ostensibly a republic,
and was directed by a counsel of ten citizens, and a chief
executive officer, called the <i>Gonfaloniere</i>, or
standard-bearer, who was chosen every two months. Under this
establishment, the citizens imagined they enjoyed the full
exercise of their liberties; but such was the power of the
Medici, that they generally either assumed to themselves the
first offices of the state, or nominated such persons as they
thought proper to those employments. In this, however, they paid
great respect to popular opinion. That opposition of interests
so generally apparent between the people and their rulers, was,
at this time, scarcely perceived at Florence, where superior
qualifications and industry were the surest recommendations to
public authority and favour. Convinced of the benefits
constantly received from this family, and satisfied that they
could, at any time, withdraw themselves from a connexion that
exacted no engagements, and required only a temporary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
acquiescence, the Florentines considered the Medici as the
fathers, and not as the rulers of the republic. On the other
hand, the chiefs of this house, by appearing rather to decline
than to court the honours bestowed on them, and by a singular
moderation of the use of them when obtained, were careful to
maintain the character of simple citizens of Florence, and
servants of the state. An interchange of reciprocal good offices
was the only tie by which the Florentines and the Medici were
bound; and, perhaps, the long continuance of this connexion may
be attributed to the very circumstance, of its being in the
power of either of the parties, at any time, to have dissolved
it.'</p>

<p class="blockquot">The temporary interruption of Cosmo's power by the successful
struggle of an opposite party, headed by families eclipsed in
his blaze, his exile, and his banishment to the Venetian state,
tended only, from the resignation and magnanimity of his
conduct, to rivet, at his recall, the voluntary chains of his
fellow-citizens;&mdash;and he continued the unrivalled arbiter of
Florence and it's dependencies, the primary restorer of Greek
and Latin literature, and the most enlightened patron of the
arts, to the advanced age of seventy-five, and the hour of his
death, gratified with the prospect of the continuation of family
power, from the character of his son Piero, and that of his two
grandsons, Lorenzo and Juliano. The ample and varied detail of
this assemblage of important subjects we leave, as preliminary,
to the curiosity of our readers, and hasten to the second
chapter, and the appearance of Lorenzo.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Lorenzo de' Medici,' says, Mr. R., p. 69, 'was about sixteen
years of age when Cosmo died, and had at that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span> time given
striking indications of extraordinary talents. From his earliest
years he had exhibited proofs of a retentive and vigorous mind,
which was cultivated not only by all the attention which his
father's infirmities would permit him to bestow, but by a
frequent intercourse with his venerable grandfather. He owed
also great obligations, in this respect, to his mother,
Lucretia, who was one of the most accomplished women of the age,
and distinguished herself not only as a patroness of learning,
but by her own writings. Of these some specimens yet remain,
which are the more entitled to approbation, as they were
produced at a time when poetry was at its lowest ebb in Italy.
The disposition of Lorenzo, which afterwards gave him a peculiar
claim to the title of <i>magnificent</i>, was apparent in his
childhood. Having received as a present a horse from Sicily, he
sent the donor, in return, a gift of much greater value, and on
being reproved for his profuseness, he remarked that there was
nothing more glorious than to overcome others in acts of
generosity. Of his proficiency in classical learning, and the
different branches of that philosophy which was then in repute,
he has left indisputable proofs. Born to restore the lustre of
his native tongue, he had rendered himself conspicuous by his
poetical talents, before he arrived at manhood. To these
accomplishments he united a considerable share of strong,
natural penetration and good sense, which enabled him, amidst
the many difficulties that he was involved in, to act with a
promptitude and decision which surprised those who were
witnesses of his conduct; whilst the endowments which entitled
him to admiration and respect, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span> accompanied by others that
conciliated, in an eminent degree, the esteem and affections of
his fellow-citizens.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'In his person, Lorenzo was tall and athletic, and had more the
appearance of strength than of elegance. From his birth, he
laboured under some peculiar disadvantages&mdash;his sight was weak,
his voice harsh and unpleasing, and he was totally deprived of
the sense of smell. With all these defects his countenance was
dignified, and gave an idea of the magnanimity of his character;
and the effects of his eloquence were conspicuous on many
important occasions. In his youth, he was much addicted to
active and laborious exercises, to hawking, horsemanship, and
country sports. Though not born to support a military character,
he gave sufficient proofs of his courage, not only in public
tournaments, which were then not unfrequent in Italy, but also
upon more trying occasions. Such was the versatility of his
talents, that it is difficult to discover any department of
business, or of amusement, of art, or of science, to which they
were not at some time applied; and in whatever he undertook, he
arrived at a proficiency which would seem to have required the
labour of a life much longer than that which he was permitted to
enjoy.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'The native energy and versatility of his character were
invigorated by a suitable education: to the notions of piety,
imbibed from Gentile d'Urbino, and perhaps from his mother, he
added the accomplishments of a scholar, under the tuition of
Landino, and received the elements of the Aristotelian and
Platonic philosophy from Argyropylus and Ficino; but that
exquisite taste in poetry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span> in music, and in every department of
the fine arts, which enabled him to contribute so powerfully
towards their restoration, was an endowment of nature, the want
of which no education could have supplied.'</p>

<p class="blockquot">Such were the qualifications with which Lorenzo entered on the
stage of public life, and which enabled him, with the political
experience he had acquired on his travels through the most
powerful states of Italy, and the connexions he had then formed,
to defeat, at his return, the conspiracy framed by Luca Pitti
against his father Piero, and probably to frustrate the war
raised against Florence by its exiles, without the loss of much
blood or treasure.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Delivered by these successes from external and domestic strife,
the Medici were at leisure again to attend to their darling
object, the promotion of learning. Several literary characters
are here delineated; principally those of Cristoforo Landino,
and Leo Battista Alberti, the Crichton of Italy, of whose
unlimited powers the greatest was perhaps that, which he, if we
believe Vasari, possessed over his horse; and our author
proceeds to the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">giostra</span>, or tournament, celebrated by Luca Pulci
and Agnolo of Monte Pulciano, in which Lorenzo and Juliano
appear to have been the principal actors, though the candidates
were eighteen in number.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'The steed upon which Lorenzo made his first appearance,' says
our historian, p. 96, 'was presented to him by Ferdinand King of
Naples. That on which he relied in the combat, by Borso Marquis
of Ferrara. The Duke of Milan had furnished him with his suit of
armour. His motto was, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le tems revient</i>; his device, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span> <i
lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fleurs de lys</i>; the privilege of using
the arms of France having shortly before been conceded to the
Medici by Louis XI., by a solemn act. His first conflict was
with Carlo Borromei; his next with Braccio de' Medici, who
attacked him with such strength and courage, that if the stroke
had taken place, Orlando himself, as the poet assures us, could
not have withstood the shock. Lorenzo took speedy vengeance, but
his spear breaking into a hundred pieces, his adversary was
preserved from total overthrow. He then assailed Carlo de Forme,
whose helmet he split, and whom he nearly unhorsed; Lorenzo then
changing his steed, made a violent attack upon Benedetto
Salutati, who had just couched his lance ready for the combat.'</p>

<p class="blockquot">Some specimens of the two panegyrics, with the plan of that
composed by Politiano, are annexed, and translated with our
author's own felicity.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The philosophical amusements of the two brothers follow next, in
a pertinent descant on the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">disputationes Camaldulenses</i> of
Landino; and after these, Lorenzo is presented to us as a lover.
The materials are furnished by his own sonnets, and the comment
he composed on them, and, though the dead and the surviving
beauties he celebrates are left nameless, there is reason to
suppose, that they were Simonetta, the deceased mistress of his
brother, and Lucretia Donati.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'The sonnets of Lorenzo,' says Mr. R., p. 116, 'rise and fall
through every degree of the thermometer of love; he exults and
he despairs; he freezes and he burns; he sings of raptures too
great for mortal sense, and he applauds <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>a severity of virtue
that no solicitations can move. From such contradictory
testimony, what are we to conclude? Lorenzo has himself
presented us with the key that unlocks this mystery. From the
relation which he has before given, we find that Lucretia was
the mistress of the poet, and not of the man. Lorenzo sought for
an object to concentrate his ideas, to give them strength, and
effect, and he found in Lucretia a subject that suited his
purpose and deserved his praise. But having so far realized his
mistress, he has dressed and ornamented her according to his own
imagination. Every action of her person, every emotion of her
mind, is subject to his control. She smiles or she frowns; she
refuses or relents; she is absent or present; she intrudes upon
his solitude by day, or visits him in his nightly dreams, just
as his presiding fancy directs.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'In the midst of these delightful visions, Lorenzo was called
upon to attend to the dull realities of life. He had now
attained his twenty-first year, and his father conceived that it
was time for him to enter into the conjugal state. To this end,
he had negotiated a marriage between Lorenzo and Clarice, the
daughter of Giacopo Orsini, of the noble and powerful Roman
family of that name, which had so long contended for superiority
with that of the Colonna. Whether Lorenzo despaired of success
in his youthful passion, or whether he subdued his feelings at
the voice of paternal authority, is left to conjecture only.
Certain, however, it is, that in the month of December 1468, he
was betrothed to a person whom, it is probable, he had never
seen, and the marriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span> ceremony was performed on the 4th day of
June, 1469.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> That the heart of Lorenzo had little share in
this engagement, is marked by a striking circumstance. In
adverting to his marriage in his Ricordi, he bluntly remarks,
that he took this lady to wife; <i>or rather</i>, says he, <i>she was
given to me</i>, on the day before-mentioned. Notwithstanding this
apparent indifference, it appears, from indisputable documents,
that a real affection subsisted between them; and there is
reason to presume that Lorenzo always treated her with
particular respect and kindness. Their nuptials were celebrated
with great splendour. Two military spectacles were exhibited,
one of which represented a field battle of horsemen, and the
other the attack and storming of a fortified citadel.'</p>

<p class="blockquot">Lorenzo's second journey to Milan, and the death of his father,
Piero, take up the remainder of this chapter. </p>

<p class="blockquot">The variety of the materials that compose the third chapter,
which opens with the political state of Italy at the time of
Lorenzo's succession to the direction of the republic, is too
great, perhaps the incidents too minute, and the transition from
event to event too rapid, to admit of extracts. The riches of
the Medici, their commercial concerns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span> and other sources of
revenue&mdash;the character of Giuliano de' Medici, that of Angelo
Politiano&mdash;the league between the Duke of Milan, the Venetians,
and the Florentines&mdash;the establishment of the academy of
Pisa&mdash;an account of Lorenzo's Poem, entitled <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Altercatione</i>, with
specimens and translations, constitute the most prominent
features of the chapter.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The fourth chapter, whether we consider the importance of the
events related, or the perspicuity and energy with which they
are developed and told, contains, in our opinion, the most
interesting period in the life of Lorenzo, the annals of
Florence, and the general history of that time. 'The conspiracy
of the Pazzi,' says our author, p. 176, was 'a transaction in
which a pope, a cardinal, an archbishop, and several other
ecclesiastics, associated themselves with a band of ruffians, to
destroy two men who were an honour to their age and country; and
purposed to perpetrate their crime at a season of hospitality,
in the sanctuary of a Christian church, and at the very moment
of the elevation of the host, when the audience bowed down
before it, and the assassins were presumed to be in the
immediate presence of their God.'</p>

<p class="blockquot">Having traced the origin of the conspiracy to Rome, and the
ambition and inveterate enmity of Sixtus the Fourth, and his
nephew, Count Girolamo Riario, to Lorenzo, Mr. R. proceeds to
their Florentine accomplices, the family of the Pazzi, whom,
though allied by intermarriages to that of the Medici, envy,
intolerance of superiority, penury, and profligacy, had rendered
their irreconcilable enemies. The young Cardinal Riario our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
author considers more as an instrument in the hands of his uncle
Girolamo, than as an accomplice in the scheme; and proceeds:</p>

<p class="blockquot">P. 180. 'This conspiracy, of which Sixtus and his nephew were
the real instigators, was first agitated at Rome, where the
intercourse between the Count Girolamo Riario and Francesco de'
Pazzi, in consequence of the office held by the latter, afforded
them an opportunity of communicating to each other their mutual
jealousy of the power of the Medici, and their desire of
depriving them of their influence in Florence; in which event it
is highly probable that the Pazzi were to have exercised the
chief authority in the city, under the patronage, if not under
the avowed dominion, of the papal see. The principal agent
engaged in the undertaking was Francesco Salviati, archbishop of
Pisa, to which rank he had lately been promoted by Sixtus, in
opposition to the Medici, who had for some time endeavoured to
prevent him from exercising his episcopal functions. If it be
allowed that the unfavourable character given of him by
Politiano is exaggerated, it is generally agreed that his
qualities were the reverse of those which ought to have been the
recommendations to such high preferment. The other conspirators
were, Giacopo Salviati, brother of the archbishop; Giacopo
Poggio, one of the sons of the celebrated Poggio Bracciolini,
and who, like all the other sons of that eminent scholar, had
obtained no small share of literary reputation; Bernardo
Bandini, a daring libertine, rendered desperate by the
consequences of his excesses; Giovan Battista Montesicco, who
had distinguished himself by his military talents, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span> one of
the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">condottieri</i> of the armies of the pope; Antonio Maffei, a
priest of Volterra; and Stephano da Bagnone, one of the
apostolic scribes, with several others of inferior note.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'In the arrangement of their plan, which appears to have been
concerted with great precaution and secrecy, the conspirators
soon discovered, that the dangers which they had to encounter
were not so likely to arise from the difficulty of the attempt,
as from the subsequent resentment of the Florentines, a great
majority of whom were strongly attached to the Medici. Hence it
became necessary to provide a military force, the assistance of
which might be equally requisite, whether the enterprise proved
abortive or successful. By the influence of the Pope, the King
of Naples, who was then in alliance with him, and on one of
whose sons he had recently bestowed a cardinal's hat, was also
induced to countenance the attempt.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'These preliminaries being adjusted, Girolamo wrote to his
nephew, Cardinal Riario, then at Pisa, ordering him to obey
whatever directions he might receive from the Archbishop. A body
of two thousand men were destined to approach by different
routes towards Florence, so as to be in readiness at the time
appointed for striking the blow.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Shortly afterwards the Archbishop requested the presence of the
Cardinal at Florence, where he immediately repaired, and took up
his residence at a seat of the Pazzi, about a mile from the
city. It seems to have been the intention of the conspirators to
have effected their purpose at Fiesole, where Lorenzo then had
his country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span> residence, to which they supposed he would invite
the Cardinal and his attendants. Nor were they deceived in this
conjecture, for Lorenzo prepared a magnificent entertainment on
this occasion; but the absence of Giuliano, on account of
indisposition, obliged the conspirators to postpone the attempt.
Disappointed in their hopes, another plan was now to be adopted;
and, on further deliberation, it was resolved, that the
assassination should take place on the succeeding Sunday, in the
Church of the Reparata, since called Santa Maria del Fiore, and
that the signal for execution should be the elevation of the
host. At the same moment, the Archbishop and others of the
conspirators were to seize upon the palace or residence of the
magistrates, whilst the office of Giacopo de Pazzi was to
endeavour, by the cry of liberty, to incite the citizens to
revolt.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'The immediate assassination of Giuliano was committed to
Francesco de' Pazzi and Bernardo Bandini, and that of Lorenzo
had been entrusted to the sole hand of Montesicco. This office
he had willingly undertaken, whilst he understood it was to be
executed in a private dwelling, but he shrunk from the idea of
polluting the House of God with so heinous a crime. Two
ecclesiastics were, therefore, selected for the commission of a
deed, from which the soldier was deterred by conscientious
motives. These were, Stefano da Bagnone, the apostolic scribe,
and Antonio Maffei.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'The young Cardinal having expressed a desire to attend divine
service in the church of the Reparata, on the ensuing Sunday,
being the 26th day of April, 1478, Lorenzo invited him and his
suite to his house in Florence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span> He accordingly came with a
large retinue, supporting the united characters of cardinal and
apostolic legate, and was received by Lorenzo with that
splendour and hospitality with which he was always accustomed to
entertain men of high rank and consequence. Giuliano did not
appear, a circumstance that alarmed the conspirators, whose
arrangements would not admit of longer delay. They soon,
however, learnt that he intended to be present at the
church.&mdash;The service was already begun, and the cardinal had
taken his seat, when Francesco de' Pazzi and Bandini, observing
that Giuliano was not yet arrived, left the church and went to
his house, in order to insure and hasten his attendance.
Giuliano accompanied them, and as he walked between them, they
threw their arms round him with the familiarity of intimate
friends, but in fact to discover whether he had any armour under
his dress; possibly conjecturing from his long delay, that he
had suspected their purpose. At the same time, by their freedom
and jocularity, they endeavoured to obviate any apprehensions
which he might entertain from such a proceeding. The
conspirators having taken their stations near their intended
victims, waited with impatience for the appointed signal. The
bell rang&mdash;the priest raised the consecrated wafer&mdash;the people
bowed before it,&mdash;and, at the same instant, Bandini plunged a
short dagger into the breast of Giuliano.&mdash;On receiving the
wound, he took a few hasty steps and fell, when Francesco de'
Pazzi rushed upon him with incredible fury, and stabbed him in
different parts of his body, continuing to repeat his strokes
even after he was apparently dead. Such was the violence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span> his
rage, that he wounded himself deeply in the thigh. The priests
who had undertaken the murder of Lorenzo were not equally
successful. An ill-directed blow from Maffei, which was aimed at
the throat, but took place behind the neck, rather roused him to
his defence than disabled him. He immediately threw off his
cloak, and holding it up as a shield in his left hand, with his
right he drew his sword and repelled his assailants. Perceiving
that their purpose was defeated, the two ecclesiastics, after
having wounded one of Lorenzo's attendants, who had interposed
to defend him, endeavoured to save themselves by flight. At the
same moment Bandini, with his dagger streaming with the blood of
Giuliano, rushed towards Lorenzo; but meeting in his way with
Francesco Nori, a person in the service of the Medici, and in
whom they placed great confidence, he stabbed him with a wound
instantaneously mortal. At the approach of Bandini, the friends
of Lorenzo encircled him and hurried him into the sacristy,
where Politiano and others closed the doors, which were of
brass. Apprehensions being entertained that the weapon which had
wounded him was poisoned, a young man attached to Lorenzo sucked
the wound. A general alarm and consternation took place in the
church; and such was the tumult which ensued, that it was at
first believed by the audience that the building was falling in;
but no sooner was it understood that Lorenzo was in danger, than
several of the youth of Florence formed themselves into a body,
and receiving him into the midst of them, conducted him to his
house, making a circuitous turn from the church, lest he should
meet with the dead body of his brother.'</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">Through the subsequent scenes of this atrocious drama as our
limits forbid to follow the author, and an abbreviated account
would do little justice to his copiousness or pathos, let it
suffice to say, that the immediate punishment inflicted on the
conspirators, was such as might be expected from the revenge of
an infuriate people. Even the Archbishop was hung from the
windows of the palace, without being suffered to divest himself
from his prelatical robes; nor ought it to be considered as a
small aggravation of their punishment, to have after death been
gibbeted for lasting infamy, by the pencil of such a villain as
Andrea dal Castagno. Happy Julian! happier Lorenzo, whom the
contemporary genius of Politiano has rescued from the equivocal
memorial of Pollajuoli.</p>

<p class="blockquot">It is with regret, we must refer the reader to the work itself
for the consequences that attended the defeat of this execrable
attempt&mdash;the storm raised by the enraged Pontiff, who now
launched excommunication on the quondam treasurer of the Holy
See, as a son of iniquity and nursling of perdition;&mdash;the war
which, at his instigation, the court of Naples commenced against
the Republic, on their refusal to deliver up Lorenzo;&mdash;it's
various success; with the result of that bold expedient by which
Lorenzo at once put an end to the miseries of his country, and
completely triumphed over all his enemies, we mean his visit to
Ferdinand himself! At that moment his genius had attained the
summit of his powers.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The fifth chapter treats of the studies of Lorenzo, and is
executed with a degree of <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">amore</i> which developes to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span> us the
favourite studies of his historian, though from the penetration
displayed in the management of all the other topics of his
hero's character, it would be unjust to apply to him the motto
of '<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tractant fabrilia fabri</i>,' or as Johnson has since expressed
it, on talking of the political disputes of Milton with
Salmasius and More, 'that let the subject of dispute be the
rights of princes and of nations, it will, if treated by
grammarians, end in grammatic squabbles.' The author is
perfectly in place and time: if we be to consider Lorenzo as a
poet, his right to that title was to be examined and
established, and the chapter became, with great propriety, part
of a treatise on poetry. After noticing the rise of Italian
literature in the fourteenth century, it's subsequent
degradation, it's revival in the fifteenth, and the rude
attempts at restoring it, by Burchiello, Matteo Franco, and the
three Pulci, that honour is conferred on Lorenzo: he is shown to
have first, among his contemporaries, discriminated the true
object, and expressed the real characteristics of poetry, in
description, poetic comparison, and personification of material
objects, of passions and affections; to have treated with
success the prosopop&oelig;ia. The sonnet, that favourite of Italy,
is next discussed, and his claims to it's honours compared with
those of Dante and Petrarca; his "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Selve d'Amore</span>," a poem in
ottava rima; his new discovered poem of "Ambra;" of the Caccia
col Falcone, his moral pieces, his sacred poems or orations, and
Laude, or Lodi, are reviewed, and specimens admirably
translated, or, to speak with more propriety, excelled, are
annexed. We then proceed to his "Beoni,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span> a piece of jocose
satire in <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">terza rima</span> on drunkenness, of which the fragment
produced and translated does at least as much honour to our
author's vein of humour, as to his hero's; and after expatiating
on the expedition with which he wrote, and many pertinent
remarks on the "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Improvisatori</span>" of Italy, its drama, opera, and
carnival songs, the chapter concludes with the opinion of the
best contemporary critics, on the poetic powers of Lorenzo.</p>

<p class="blockquot">As the mutual limits of poetry and painting are so frequently
confounded, it may not be improper to extract what our author
says on the objects and characteristics of poetry. Vol. 1. p.
255.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'The great end and object of poetry, and consequently, the
proper aim of the poet, is to communicate to us a clear and
perfect idea of his proposed subject. What the painter exhibits
by variety of colour, by light and shade, the poet expresses in
appropriate language. The former seizes only the external form,
and that only in a given attitude. The other surrounds his
object, pierces it, and discloses its most hidden qualities.
With the former, it is inert and motionless; with the latter, it
lives and moves; it is expanded or compressed; it glares upon
the imagination, or vanishes into air, and is as various as
Nature herself.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'The simple description of natural objects is perhaps to a young
mind the most delightful species of poetry, and was probably the
first employment of the poet. It may be compared to melody in
music, which is relished even by the most uncultivated ear. In
this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span> department Virgil is an exquisite master.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Still more
lively are the conceptions of Dante, still more precise the
language in which they are expressed. As we follow him, his
wildest excursions take the appearance of reality. Compared with
his vivid hues, how faint, how delicate, is the colouring of
Petrarca! yet the harmony of the tints almost compensate for
their want of force. With accurate descriptions of the face of
Nature the works of Lorenzo abound; and these are often
heightened by those minute but striking characteristics, which
though open to all observers, the eye of the poet can alone
select. Thus the description of an Italian winter, with which he
opens his poem of <i>Ambra</i><a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>, is marked by several appropriate

<p class="blockquot">'In the same poem is a description of the golden age, in which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the author seems to have exerted all his powers, in selecting
such images as are supposed to have been peculiar to that happy
state of life.'</p>

<p class="blockquot">Mr. R., with great propriety, places the essence of poetic
diction,&mdash;not of poesy itself, for that consists in
invention,&mdash;in representing its object in motion, to impress us
with it's variety of action and attitudes; in short, in
following <i>time</i>, avoiding a minute anatomy of motionless
surfaces, to which words, it's vehicle, are totally inadequate.
Surface can only be distinctly discriminated by line and colour.
Hence it is evident that poetry cannot in this respect be either
put in comparison with, or be elevated above painting; the
province of their expression, and effect, must be for ever
separate, though they perfectly coincide in their aim, which is
to charm and convince the senses. Thus, when poetry attempts to
describe an object, it must confine itself to one, or a very few
words, in whatever merely relates to the shape or surface of
that object, and it's more profuse description is <i>only then</i> in
it's place, when that object begins to move. Such is the rule of
Nature and of Homer, from which no ancient or modern poet has
deviated with impunity; and <i>Ariosto</i>, who has described the
shape, figure, and colour of Alcina, in five stanzas, has
laboured as much in vain to acquaint us with the ingredients of
his witch-beauty, as <i>Constantinus Manasses</i> to give us a clear
idea of Helen by his agglomeration of epithets, or as Haller of
the Genziana, by a description of nineteen lines. The images
which Mr. R. adduces from Lorenzo confirm this; they attain
their effect merely by hastening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span> from the body of the object to
it's motion. Not the most expressive words of the most
expressive language ever given to man, arranged by Homer or
Milton, or a power still superior to their's, could produce a
sensation equal to that which is instantaneously received by one
glance on the face of the Venus de' Medici, or in that of the
Apollo in Belvedere; and if the spark, which Phidias caught from
the Zeus of Homer, were shot by his <i>waving</i> locks and the <i>nod</i>
of his brow, will it be denied that <i>Ctesilas</i> in his expiring
warrior, from whose expression might be collected how much
remained of life, or <i>Aristides</i> in the wounded mother, who, in
the pangs of death, struggled to remove her child from her
palsied nipple, 'surrounded, pierced, and disclosed the most
hidden qualities of their objects?'</p>

<p class="blockquot">From what Mr. R. with great acuteness remarks on poetic
comparison, we have extracted the following sonnet of Lorenzo,
with the translation, 'not only,' as he adds, 'as an instance of
the illustration of one sensible object by another, but of the
comparison of an abstract sentiment with a beautiful natural
image.' P. 260.</p>

</div></div>

<p class="blockquot">The wing, the harp, the hatchet, the altar of <i>Simmias</i>, were
the dregs of a degraded nation's worn-out taste; but it is
matter of surprise, that a race celebrated for susceptibility of
sentiment should have submitted to lisp their first accents, and
continued to breathe their full raptures of love, in the
trammels of a sonnet. If, as may reasonably be supposed, the
first twister of a sonnet were a being of a versatile head and
frozen heart, the beauties thronged into this little labyrinth,
it's glowing words,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span> and thoughts that burn, whether we consider
the original, or it's more than equal translation, equally
challenge our admiration and sympathy.</p>

<p class="blockquot">We must yet be allowed to make a few observations on what our
author, perhaps with greater ingenuity than impartiality,
pronounces on the comparative excellence of the ancients and
moderns in the use of the prosopop&oelig;ia.</p>

<p class="blockquot">P.266.&mdash;'If the moderns excel the ancients in any department of
poetry, it is in that now under consideration. It must not
indeed be supposed, that the ancients were insensible of the
effects produced by this powerful charm, which, more peculiarly
than any other, may be said</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4"><i>To give to airy nothing</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i4"><i>A local habitation and a name.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="blockquot">But it may safely be asserted, that they have availed themselves
of this creative faculty much more sparingly, and with much less
success, than their modern competitors. The attribution of sense
to inert objects, is indeed common to both; but that still
bolder exertion, which embodies abstract existence, and renders
it susceptible of ocular representation, is almost exclusively
the boast of the moderns.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> </p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">'If, however, we advert to the few authors who preceded Lorenzo
de' Medici, we shall not trace in their writings many striking
instances of those embodied pictures of ideal existence, which
are so conspicuous in the works of Ariosto, Spenser, Milton, and
subsequent writers of the higher class, who are either natives
of Italy, or have formed their taste upon the poets of that
nation.'</p>

<p class="blockquot">To enforce his premises, the author produces a variety of
tableaux from the writings of his hero, and not without
appearance of success, to show his superiority in this species
of composition.</p>

<p class="blockquot">To invalidate the claim of the moderns, with their fragments of
personification, it might, perhaps, be sufficient to call to the
reader's mind that immense mass of prosopop&oelig;ia, on which the
ancients established the ostensible fabric of their religion.
What were the divinities that filled their temples, but images
of things, personifications<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span> of the powers of nature? and were
not these the auxiliaries of their poets? Discriminated by
characteristics so appropriate and so decisive, that no
observation of succeeding ages has been able to add any thing
essential, or to subtract any thing as superfluous from their
insignia. At this moment, the poet and the artist subsist on
their sterling properties; and the greatest of the moderns could
do no more than recompose from the birth of Minerva, the charms
of Pandora, and the horrors of Scylla, the origin, the beauty,
and the deformities of his Sin; and if, by the superhuman flight
of his fancy, he snatched the attributes and shape of Death from
a region yet unexplored by former wings, the being itself had
not been unknown to the ancients; it carried off Alceste, and
offered battle in it's gloom to Hercules. But will it be denied,
that by personifying the <i>act</i> by which his heroes were to fall,
and the <i>punishment</i> attendant on that act, Milton has, as far
as in him lay, destroyed the <i>credibility</i> of his poem? Homer
found the <i>abstractions</i>, which he mingled with the real actors
of his poem, already personified; and to demand a belief in the
existence of Minerva or Jupiter, subjected his reader to no
greater exertion, than to believe in the existence of Achilles
or Ulysses. Had credibility not been the great principle of
Homer, had he introduced <i>Wisdom</i> seizing <i>Achilles</i> by the
hair, and <i>Beauty</i> ravishing <i>Paris</i> from the combat, the Iliad,
in what concerns the plan, would be little more than the rival
of the Pilgrim's Progress.</p>

<p class="blockquot">But if Homer <i>refused admittance to new-personified beings</i> as
actors of his poem, has he contented himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span> entirely with
monosyllabic animation of the inanimate, with roaring shores,
remorseless stones, or maddening lances? The enormous image of
<i>Discord</i> in the fourth, the picturesque prosopop&oelig;ia of
<i>Prayers</i> and <i>Guilt</i> in the ninth, and the luxuriant episode of
<i>Guilt</i> again in the nineteenth book of the "Ilias," not only
prove the contrary, but establish him beyond all competition,
Milton perhaps excepted, as the first master of that poetic
figure. The <i>Liberty</i> of Petrarch, and the <i>Jealousy</i> and <i>Hope</i>
of Lorenzo de' Medici, may with equal propriety adopt the names
of <i>Health</i>, <i>Suspicion</i>, and <i>Curiosity</i>; but the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Litæ</i> of
Homer are images discriminated from all others, and will rank as
models of true prosopop&oelig;ia without the assistance of Hesiod,
Æschylus, or the love-embodying romance of Apuleius.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The Appendix to the first volume consists of forty-two pieces,
and contains the political and literary documents of the
history. Of these the papers relative to the conspiracy of the
Pazzi, especially the commentarium of Poliziano, the brief of
excommunication of Sixtus IV, the reply of the Florentine Synod,
and the deposition of Giambattista de Montesicco before his
execution, are the most interesting.</p>

<p class="blockquot">One great prerogative of the author is, no doubt, that happy
distribution of matter, by which the grave and the more amusing
parts of the subject alternately relieve each other. Having left
his reader "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">con la bocca dolce</span>," at the conclusion of the first
volume, Mr. R. at the beginning of the second, exhibits the
rival of Petrarch, if not as the founder, at least as the first
who gave action and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span> energy to that conciliating system of
politics, since denominated the balance of power, the darling
maxim of modern statesmen.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'The situation of Italy,' says our author, p. 4, 'at this
period, afforded an ample field for the exercise of political
talents. The number of independent states of which it was
composed, the inequality of their strength, the ambitious views
of some, and the ever-active fears of others, kept the whole
country in continual agitation and alarm. The vicinity of these
states to each other, and the narrow bounds of their respective
dominions, required a promptitude of decision, in cases of
disagreement, unexampled in any subsequent period of modern
history. Where the event of open war seemed doubtful, private
treachery was without scruple resorted to; and where that failed
of success, an appeal was again made to arms. The Pontifical See
had itself set the example of a mode of conduct that burst
asunder all the bonds of society, and operated as a convincing
proof that nothing was thought unlawful which appeared to be
expedient. To counterpoise all the jarring interests of these
different governments, to restrain the powerful, to succour the
weak, and to unite the whole in one firm body, so as to enable
them on the one hand successfully to oppose the formidable power
of the Turks, and on the other, to repel the incursions of the
French and the Germans, both of whom were objects of terror to
the less warlike inhabitants of Italy, were the important ends
which Lorenzo proposed to accomplish. The effectual defence of
the Florentine dominions against the encroachments of their more
powerful neighbours,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span> though perhaps his chief inducement for
engaging in so extensive a project, appeared, in the execution
of it, rather as a necessary part of his system than as the
principal object which he had in view. In these transactions, we
may trace the first decisive instance of that political
arrangement, which was more fully developed and more widely
extended in the succeeding century, and which has since been
denominated the balance of power. Casual alliances, arising from
consanguinity, from personal attachment, from vicinity, or from
interest, had indeed frequently subsisted among the Italian
States; but these were only partial and temporary engagements,
and rather tended to divide the country into two or more
powerful parties, than to counterpoise the interests of
individual governments, so as to produce in the result the
general tranquillity.'<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> </p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">Before, however, Lorenzo could proceed to the execution of his
beneficent system, he had to thank his stars for a second escape
from a new conspiracy formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span> against his life, at the
instigation of his old and inveterate enemies, the Riarii, by
Battista Frescobaldi. This attempt, conducted with less
prudence, had none of the atrocious consequences of the first,
but ended in the immediate destruction of Frescobaldi and his
Tuscan accomplices. Cursorily however, as it is related by our
author, it appears to have made a deep impression on the mind of
his hero, since he adopted, in consequence of it, a measure of
safety which even the homicide Cesar had scorned, that of
appearing in public guarded by a select band of armed friends.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The author now proceeds at length, and with equal perspicuity,
impartiality, and diligence, to detail the progress of Lorenzo's
measures to secure and establish the independence of Florence,
and to compose the jarring interests of Italy. Popes, kings,
petty princes, republics, appear in succession, poised,
supported, checked, advised, reconciled, to cement his generous
plan. Eloquence, military skill, caution, liberality,
intrepidity, stamp him by turns the soul of his own, and the
arbiter of the surrounding states, till at length the whole is
composed and well poised,&mdash;Italy enjoys security and peace. Such
is the general outline; a more minute detail, as it would exceed
our limits, could in a meagre summary serve only to weary the
reader: the materials vary, the contending parties are not
equally important, the heroes sometimes relax; conquests give
way to a leader's indisposition, and battles are fought which
remind us of Virgil's winged squadrons;</p>

<p class="blockquot"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>Chap. VII. From politics, negotiations, and war, we follow our
author to his academic shades, to the improvements in classic
learning made under the fostering patronage of Lorenzo; to the
importation of Greek literature by Emanuel Chrysoloras, Joannes
Argyropylus, Demetrius Chalcondyles; to the introduction of
printing, the progress of the Laurentian library, and the
establishment of a Greek academy at Florence. We are made
acquainted with Politiano; his merits as a civilian, critic,
translator, controvertist, and poet: Giovanni Pico, Prince of
Mirandola, next excites our wonder; and after him, Linacer
Landino, and the two Verini might claim our attention, were they
not eclipsed by the female efforts of Alessandra Scala, and
Cassandra Fidelis.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'It might have been expected,' says our author, p. 55, after
having premised some observations on the seemingly unattainable
excellence of Dante, Petrarca, and Boccaccio, 'that the
successful efforts of these authors to improve their native
tongue, would have been more effectual than the weak, though
laudable, attempts made by them to revive the study of the
ancient languages; but it must be remembered, that they were all
of them men of genius, and genius assimilates not with the
character of the age. Homer and Shakspeare have no imitators,
and are no models. The example of such talents is perhaps, upon
the whole, unfavourable to the general progress of improvement;
and the superlative abilities of a few, have more than once
damped the ardour of a nation. But if the great Italian authors
were inimitable in the productions of their native language, in
their Latin writings they appeared in a subordinate character.
Of the labours of the ancients, enough had been discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span> to
mark the decided difference between their merits and those of
their modern imitators; and the applauses bestowed upon the
latter, were only in proportion to the degree in which they
approached the models of ancient eloquence. This competition
was, therefore, eagerly entered into; nor had the success of the
first revivers of these studies deprived their followers of the
hope of surpassing them. Even the early part of the fifteenth
century produced scholars as much superior to Petrarca, and his
coadjutors, as they were to the monkish compilers, and
scholastic disputants, who immediately preceded them; and the
labours of Leonardo Aretino, Gianozzo Manetti, Guarino Veronese,
and Poggio Bracciolini, prepared the way for the still more
correct and classical productions of Politiano, Sannazaro,
Pontano, and Augurelli. The declining state of Italian
literature, so far then from being inconsistent with, was rather
a consequence of the proficiency made in other pursuits, which,
whilst they were distinguished by a greater degree of celebrity,
demanded a more continued attention, and an almost absolute
devotion both of talents and of time.'</p>

<p class="blockquot">It would be injustice to suppose that, by this well turned and
energetic passage, our author could mean to depreciate the
benign influence of original genius, or to insinuate aught
against the necessity of it's periodical appearance: his aim is
to assign their proper place to the literati of the epoch he
describes, to trace the probable motives of their pursuits, and
to show, that by a judicious choice they supplied, in some
degree, their want of innate power, and even of discernment in
their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span> objects of imitation. Who, better than our historian,
knows, that, if Nature be inexhaustible in her resources and
productions, and genius be merely a power, seizing and
representing with clearness some of her features, the appearance
of one man of genius can no more check the perceptions, than
preclude the existence of another? He who takes Homer or Michael
Angelo for his model, adopts him merely as his medium to see
Nature more distinctly or on a grander scale; he imitates
without copying, like Virgil and Pelegrino Tibaldi, for whom it
will be difficult to find a name, if they be refused that of
imitators of the Ionian and the Tuscan genius. If the supposed
inaccessible excellence of Dante and his contemporaries
dispirited the Italians of the fifteenth century from the
cultivation of the higher Italian poetry, it proved not that
they had exhausted Nature, but that they were no longer
understood; and that they were not, almost every line of their
pedantic commentators proves. Machiavelli, Ariosto, Tasso,
appeared after them, with the same models before their eyes, and
each produced works none would wish to exchange for all the
laboured lucubrations of Tuscan Latinists: the fact is, it was
easier to shine before a partial public formed by themselves,
with glittering compilations of classic lines, almost always
dishonoured by some clumsy or gothic addition of their own, than
to emulate the pace of their great predecessors before the
general eye.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The domestic character of Lorenzo, the wit, the husband, father,
friend, appear in the eighth chapter. The author examines and
acquits him of the charge of having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span> been addicted to licentious
amours, and exhibits him, if not as a tender, at least as a
civil husband: but "in no point of view," says he, "does the
character of this extraordinary man appear more engaging than in
his affection towards his children, in his care of their
education, and in his solicitude for their welfare." He
accordingly, on each of these particulars, enters into very
interesting details: we are introduced to the characters of his
sons, Piero and Giovanni, the first known as his successor, the
second celebrated as supreme pontiff under the assumed name of
Leo X. From his children, we pass on to Lorenzo's domestic
concerns. His villas, Poggio Cajano, Careggi, Fiesole, and other
domains, pass in review. The visits of Piero to Rome and Milan,
his marriage with Alfonsina Orsini; the exaltation of Giovanni
to the dignity of cardinal at the age of fourteen, his father's
admirable admonitory letter to him on that occasion; the death
of Madonna Clarice, Lorenzo's wife; his patronage of learned
ecclesiastics; the assassination of G. Riario, and the tragic
death of Galeotto Manfredi, Prince of Faenza, occupy the
remainder.</p>

<p class="blockquot">If the subject of the ninth chapter, the progress of the plastic
arts, under the patronage of the Medici, reflect a new lustre on
the beneficent grandeur of that family, the judgment,
perspicuity, elegance of taste, and 'amore,' with which it is
treated by our author, reflect almost equal honour on himself.
From the obscure dawn of Cimabue to the noonday splendour of M.
Angelo, we are gradually led to form our ideas of art with a
precision and distinctness, in vain looked for in the
loquacious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span> volumes and indiscriminate panegyrics of Vasari.
Among so many beauties, the choice of selection is difficult; a
short extract from one or two passages will inform the reader
what he is to expect from the whole. After mentioning the
successful efforts of Lorenzo, Ghiberti and Donatello, the
author continues:</p>

<p class="blockquot">P. 189.&mdash;'Notwithstanding the exertions of these masters, which
were regarded with astonishment by their contemporaries, and are
yet entitled to attention and respect, it does not appear that
they had raised their views to the true end of the profession.
Their characters rarely excelled the daily prototypes of common
life, and their forms, although at times sufficiently accurate,
were mostly vulgar and heavy. In the pictures which remain of
this period, the limbs are not marked with that precision which
characterizes a well-informed artist. The hands and feet in
particular appear soft, enervated, and delicate, without
distinction of sex or character. Many practices yet remain that
evince the imperfect state of the art. Ghirlandajo and
Baldovinetti continued to introduce the portraits of their
employers in historic composition, forgetful of that <i
lang="la" xml:lang="la">simplex duntaxat et unum</i> with which a
just taste can never dispense. Cosimo Roselli, a painter of no
inconsiderable reputation, attempted, by the assistance of gold
and ultramarine, to give a factitious splendour to his
performances. To every thing great and elevated, the art was yet
a stranger; even the celebrated picture of Pollajuolo exhibits
only a group of half-naked and vulgar wretches, discharging
their arrows at a miserable fellow-creature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span> who by changing
places with one of his murderers, might with equal propriety
become a murderer himself.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Nor was it till the time of
Michaelagnolo, that painting and sculpture rose to their true
object, and instead of exciting the wonder, began to rouse the
passions and interest the feelings of mankind.'</p>

<p class="blockquot">Though indignant at the doating tradition which still presumes
to foist the bedlam trash of Titus Andronicus among Shakspeare's
pieces; and certainly as little partial to the rubric of
martyrologies as our author or Mr. Tenhove; we yet believe, that
their observation receives it's force rather from the
insensibility, perhaps brutality, of artists, than from the
subject itself. Let horror and loathsomeness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span> be banished from
the instruments of art, and the martyrdom of Stephen or
Sebastian, Agnes or John, becomes as admissible as that of
Marsyas or Palamedes, Virginia, or Regulus. It is the artist's
fault if the right moment be missed. If you see only blood-tipt
arrows, brain-dashed stones, excoriating knives, the artist, not
the subject, is detestable; this furnished heroism, celestial
resignation, the features of calm fortitude and beauty,
helpless, but undismayed; the clown or brute alone, who handled
it, pushed you down among the assassins from the hero's side.
Humanity may avert our eyes with propriety from the murdered
subjects of Pietro Testa, Joseph Ribera, sometimes even of
Domenicho himself; but apathy, phlegm,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> effeminacy, alone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>would prefer an Andromeda, an Agave, or a Venus hanging over an
expiring Adonis, to the "Madonna del Spasmo" of Raffaello, or M.
Angelo's Crucifixion of St. Peter. </p>

<p class="blockquot">We next present the reader with the following passage on
Michaelagnolo.</p>

<p class="blockquot">P. 208.&mdash;'The labours of the painter are necessarily transitory,
for so are the materials that compose them. In a few years
Michaelagnolo will be known like an ancient artist, only by his
works in marble. Already it is difficult to determine whether
his reputation be enhanced or diminished by the sombre
representations of his pencil in the Pauline and Sixtine
chapels, or by the few specimens of his cabinet pictures, now
rarely to be met with, and exhibiting only a shadow of their
original excellence. But the chief merit of this great man is
not to be sought for in the remains of his pencil, nor even in
his sculptures, but in the general improvement of the public
taste which followed his astonishing productions. If his labours
had perished with himself, the change which they effected in the
opinions and the works of his contemporaries would still have
entitled him to the first honours of the art. Those who from
ignorance, or from envy, have endeavoured to depreciate his
productions, have represented them as exceeding in their forms
and attitudes the limits and the possibilities of nature, as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
race of beings, the mere creatures of his own imagination; but
such critics would do well to consider, whether the great reform
to which we have alluded could have been effected by the most
accurate representations of common life, and whether any thing
short of that ideal excellence which he only knew to embody
could have accomplished so important a purpose. The genius of
Michaelagnolo was a leaven which was to operate on an immense
and heterogeneous mass, the salt intended to give a relish to
insipidity itself; it was therefore active, penetrating,
energetic, so as not only effectually to resist the contagious
effects of a depraved taste, but to communicate a portion of its
spirit to all around.'</p>

<p class="blockquot">The comprehensive conception and energy of this admirable
passage prove our author to have penetrated farther into the
character of Michaelagnolo, and to have found far more accurate
ideas of his real prerogative, than either of his favourite
biographers.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> </p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">Before we dismiss this chapter, we state it as matter of
surprise, that the accomplishments and gigantic powers of
Lionardo da Vinci, a man nearly of Lorenzo's own age, appear to
have shared in none of the favours which he showered on inferior
artists.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Chap. X. We approach with regret the concluding period of this
history, the last moments and death of Lorenzo. Our regret is
increased by the limits prescribed to our review, as our author,
if possible, rises here above the preceding chapters, in the
accumulation of interesting circumstances, delineation of
character, and pathetic scenery. The death of his hero involves
that of the most conspicuous characters around him, of
Politiano, Pico, Ermolao; the expulsion of his family, and the
death of his unfortunate son soon follow; and with the
reinstatement of the Medici, the extinction of the republic,
after the unsuccessful struggles of Lorenzino de' Medici, and
Philippo Strozzi, under the establishment of a tyranny, finishes
the work. From so rich an aggregate of materials, we must
content ourselves with a single extract, the character of
Lorenzo and our author's review of his conduct as a statesman.</p>

<p class="blockquot">P. 239. 'In the height of his reputation, and at a premature
period of life, thus died Lorenzo de' Medici; a man who may be
selected from all the characters of ancient and modern history,
as exhibiting the most remarkable instance of depth of
penetration, versatility of talent, and comprehension of mind.
Whether genius be a predominating impulse, directing the mind to
some particular object, or whether it be an energy of intellect
that arrives at excellence in any department in which it may be
employed, it is certain that there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span> few instances in which a
successful exertion in any human pursuit has not occasioned a
dereliction of many other objects, the attainment of which might
have conferred immortality. If the powers of the mind are to
bear down all obstacles that oppose their progress, it seems
necessary that they should sweep along in some certain course,
and in one collected mass. What then shall we think of that rich
fountain, which, whilst it was poured out by so many different
channels, flowed through each with a full and equal stream? To
be absorbed in one pursuit, however important, is not the
characteristic of the higher class of genius, which, piercing
through the various combinations and relations of surrounding
circumstances, sees all things in their just dimensions, and
attributes to each its due. Of the various occupations in which
Lorenzo engaged, there is not one in which he was not eminently
successful; but he was most particularly distinguished in those
which justly hold the first rank in human estimation. The
facility with which he turned from subjects of the highest
importance to those of amusement and levity, suggested to his
countrymen the idea that he had two distinct souls combined in
one body. Even his moral character seems to have partaken in
some degree of the same diversity, and his devotional poems are
as ardent as his lighter pieces are licentious. On all sides, he
touched the extremes of human character, and the powers of his
mind were only bounded by that impenetrable circle which
prescribes the limits of human nature.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'As a statesman, Lorenzo de' Medici appears to peculiar
advantage. Uniformly employed in securing the peace <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>and
promoting the happiness of his country, by just regulations at
home, and wise precautions abroad, and teaching to the
surrounding governments those important lessons of political
science, on which the civilization and tranquillity of nations
have since been found to depend. Though possessed of undoubted
talents for military exploits, and of sagacity to avail himself
of the imbecility of neighbouring powers, he was superior to
that avarice of dominion, which, without improving what is
already acquired, blindly aims at more extensive possession. The
wars in which he engaged were for security, not for territory;
and the riches produced by the fertility of the soil, and the
industry and ingenuity of the inhabitants of the Florentine
republic, instead of being dissipated in imposing projects and
ruinous expeditions, circulated in their natural channels,
giving happiness to the individual, and respectability to the
state. If he was not insensible to the charms of ambition, it
was the ambition to deserve rather than to enjoy; and he was
always cautious not to exact from the public favour more than it
might be voluntarily willing to bestow. The approximating
suppression of the liberties of Florence, under the influence of
his descendants, may induce suspicions unfavourable to his
patriotism; but it will be difficult, not to say impossible, to
discover, either in his conduct or his precepts, any thing that
ought to stigmatize him as an enemy to the freedom of his
country. The authority which he exercised was the same as that
which his ancestors had enjoyed, without injury to the republic,
for nearly a century, and had descended to him as inseparable
from the wealth, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span> respectability, and the powerful foreign
connexions of his family. The superiority of his talents enabled
him to avail himself of these advantages with irresistible
effect; but history suggests not an instance in which they were
devoted to any other purpose than that of promoting the honour
and the independence of the Tuscan state. It is not by the
continuance, but by the dereliction of the system that he had
established, and to which he adhered to the close of his life,
that the Florentine republic sunk under the degrading yoke of
despotic power; and to his premature death we may unquestionably
attribute, not only the destruction of the commonwealth, but all
the calamities that Italy soon afterwards sustained.'</p>

<p class="blockquot">Though we admire the author's eloquence, and in a great measure
subscribe to this character, some doubts may be entertained,
whether Lorenzo had not to thank a premature death for having
left his political character, if not unsuspected, at least
unimpeached by direct proofs. Aggrandisement by enormous
accumulation of wealth, and that obtained, by cautious but
unremitting grasps at power, appears to have been the leading
principle of the Medicean family: hence those sacrifices of
private attachments and animosities; hence that ambition of
connecting themselves by intermarriage with the most powerful
families of the surrounding powers; hence the indecent, though
successful attempt of raising a boy to the dignity of Cardinal,
against the qualms of an else willing Pontiff; steps not easily
accounted for from men who professed the honour of being
considered as the first citizens of Florence, to be the height
of their ambition.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">But let us return for a moment to our historian, whose work we
cannot dismiss without adding our feeble vote to the unbounded
applause which it has obtained from the best part of the public.
Mr. R., in our opinion, possesses a high rank among the
historians of his country. Notwithstanding the modesty of the
title, the life of Lorenzo de' Medici unites the general history
of the times, and the political system of the most memorable
country in Europe, with the characters of the most celebrated
men, and the rise and progress of science and arts. The greatest
praise of the historian and biographer, impartiality, might be
called its most prominent feature, were it not excelled by the
humanity of the writer, who touches with a hand often too
gentle, those blemishes which he scorns to disguise. It is
impossible to read any part of his performance without
discovering that an ardent love for the true interests of
society, and a fervid attachment to virtue and real liberty,
have furnished his motives of choice, and every where directed
his pen. The diligence and correctness of judgment by which the
matter is selected and distributed, notwithstanding the
scantiness, obscurity, or partiality of the documents that were
to be consulted, are equalled only by the amenity with which he
has varied his subjects, and the surprising extent of his
information. Simplicity, perspicuity, and copiousness, are the
leading features of his style, often sententious without being
abrupt, and decided without an air of dogma; that it should have
been sometimes verbose, sometimes lax or minute, is less to be
wondered at, than that it should never be disgraced by
affectation or pretence of elegance. If we be not always led by
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span> nearest road, our path is always strewn with flowers; and,
if it be the highest praise of writing to have made delight the
effectual vehicle of instruction, our author has attained it.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The Appendix, of upwards of forty documents relative to the
text, many highly interesting, is preceded by some original
poems of Lorenzo, copied by Mr. Clarke, from the MSS. preserved
in the Laurentian library, and now published for the first time.

<p class="blockquot">Fuseli's Marriage.&mdash;His inducements to associate himself with
the Royal Academy.&mdash;He translates Lavater's "Aphorisms on
Man."&mdash;Remarks on his own "Aphorisms on Art."&mdash;Particulars of
Fuseli's acquaintance with Mrs. Wollstonecraft. </p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">On</span> the 30th June, 1788, Fuseli married Miss Sophia Rawlins, of Bath
Easton, near Bath, a young lady of reputable parentage and of personal
attractions. She had been for some time on a visit to an aunt who
resided in London. In Mrs. Fuseli he found an excellent wife, and with
her he lived happily for thirty-five years. She now survives him. On his
marriage he removed from St. Martin's lane, and took a house, No. 72,
Queen Anne Street, East, now called Foley Street: where he painted most
of the pictures which subsequently composed "The Milton Gallery."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>This alteration in his condition effected, from prudential motives, some
change in his mode of acting, if not of thinking. Hitherto, he had a
distaste to all associated bodies for teaching the fine arts; and, in
consequence, refused to belong to some foreign academies during his
residence in Italy; nor would he attend to the repeated recommendations
of his friends (particularly of Sir Joshua Reynolds and Mr. Alderman
Boydell) to become a candidate for the Royal Academy. But being now a
married man, and far from opulent, the consideration of the pension
usually granted by the Royal Academy, under such circumstances, to the
widows of their members, overcame his reluctance; and having put down
his name, and forced himself to undergo the penance of solicitation,
which the members of this as well as several other self-elective bodies
expect from candidates as a right, he was elected an associate of the
Royal Academy on the 3d November, 1788.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the year (1789), Fuseli published, in a small
duodecimo volume, a translation of Lavater's "Aphorisms on Man;" which
work, written in German, was dedicated to him by this early and esteemed
friend. The dedication is dated October, 1787. When Fuseli gave this
book in an English dress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span> it was with a promise, that a corresponding
volume of "aphorisms on art," (not, indeed, by the same author,) "should
appear in the course of the year." In conformity to this intention, one
sheet was worked off and corrected by him; but an accidental fire having
taken place in the premises of the printer, the whole impression was
destroyed, and Fuseli could never bring himself to undergo the task of
another revision. It is, however, so far fortunate, that the aphorisms
now appear not only in a more concise, correct, and, in point of number,
extended form, but they are also accompanied by many corollaries; for
adding the latter, he gave to me this reason,&mdash;"that an aphorism may be
discussed, but ought not to contain its own explication." These
aphorisms, which are not entirely confined to art, but embrace also life
and character, are certainly the master-work of Fuseli in literature:
many of them, it is true, he has used by amplification in his lectures,
and in the notes to "Pilkington's Dictionary of the Painters;" but what
he himself wrote as an advertisement to Lavater's Aphorisms, may be
fairly said of the work as a whole, that it "will be found to contain
what gives their value to maxims,&mdash;verdicts of wisdom on the reports of
experience. If some are truisms, let it be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span> considered that Solomon and
Hippocrates wrote truisms: if some are not new, they are recommended by
an air of novelty."</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1790, Fuseli became acquainted with the celebrated Mary
Wollstonecraft. Several publications having gone so far as totally to
misrepresent the nature of his intercourse with this highly-gifted lady,
it becomes the duty of his biographer to give a plain statement of
facts.</p>

<p>The talents of Mrs. Wollstonecraft<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> were first brought into notice by
the Rev. John Hewlett, who, to forward her views in getting employment
by writing on literary subjects, introduced her to Mr. Joseph Johnson,
bookseller, in St. Paul's Church-yard. The house and purse of this
liberal man were always open to authors who possessed talents, and who
required pecuniary assistance; and such being the case with Mrs.
Wollstonecraft, she was a frequent visitor at Mr. Johnson's: there
Fuseli met her; but as he was not very ready to make new acquaintances,
and was not only a shy man, but had rather a repulsive manner to those
he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span> did not know, so it was some time before they became intimately
acquainted.</p>

<p>The eyes of all Europe were at this time fixed upon the passing events
in France. That spirit of liberty inherent in the Swiss, now burst forth
in Fuseli, and he considered, as did his friend and countryman Lavater,
that an opportunity was then offered to mankind to assert and secure
their liberties, which no previous period in the history of the world
had afforded. The same feelings animated the bosom of Mrs.
Wollstonecraft: this was kept up, and indeed heightened by her then
daily occupation, that of translating from the French the political
pamphlets of the day, which at this time met with a ready and rapid
sale; and in writing criticisms on them, as well as upon other subjects,
for the Analytical Review.</p>

<p>Congruity of sentiments and feelings upon points which occupied the
thoughts, and engrossed the conversation of persons in all ranks and
stations of life, naturally brought about a closer intimacy between
Fuseli and Mrs. Wollstonecraft, the consequences of which were not
foreseen by the lady; for she little thought that the attachment on her
part, which proceeded from it, would be the cause of her leaving this
country, and thus becoming an eye-witness of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>the system of Gallic
liberty which she attempted to uphold, emanating, as it did, from
philosophers, being destroyed by murderers and madmen.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wollstonecraft had the strongest desire to be useful to her
connexions and friends, and she began her career in life by sacrificing
her feelings and comforts to what she fancied purity of conduct, and the
benefit of others. It was a favourite consideration with her, that she
"was designed to rise superior to her earthly habitation," and that she
"always thought, with some degree of horror, of falling a sacrifice to a
passion which may have a mixture of dross in it."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Having a face and person which had some pretensions to beauty and
comeliness, Mrs. Wollstonecraft had been frequently solicited to marry;
but previously to her acquaintance with Mr. Fuseli, she had never known
any man "possessed of those noble qualities, that grandeur of soul, that
quickness of comprehension, and lively sympathy," which she fancied
would be essential to her happiness, if she entered into the marriage
state. These she found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span> in him; but there was a bar to all her hopes in
this quarter; for he was already married to a woman whom he loved.</p>

<p>For some years before their acquaintance, with the view of usefulness
which she had prescribed to herself, Mrs. Wollstonecraft "read no book
for mere amusement, not even poetry, but studied those works only which
are addressed to the understanding; she scarcely tasted animal food, or
allowed herself the necessaries of life, that she might be able to
pursue some romantic schemes of benevolence; seldom went to any
amusements (being resident chiefly at Bath, and in the midst of
pleasure), and her clothes were scarcely decent in her situation of
life." The notions of privation which some of the revolutionists in
France were now endeavouring to inculcate, rather encreased than
diminished this tendency in Mrs. Wollstonecraft, and Fuseli found in her
(what he most disliked in woman) a philosophical sloven: her usual dress
being a habit of coarse cloth, such as is now worn by milk-women, black
worsted stockings, and a beaver hat, with her hair hanging lank about
her shoulders. These notions had their influence also in regard to the
conveniences of life; for when the Prince Talleyrand was in this
country, in a low condition with regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span> to his pecuniary affairs, and
visited her, they drank their tea, and the little wine they took,
indiscriminately from tea-cups.</p>

<p>Fuseli had a talent for conversation peculiar to himself, and his
knowledge of the classics, of literature in general, and of the fine
arts, was extensive, and his memory so retentive, that he seldom forgot
what he had read or seen; these, aided by a great power and fluency of
words, a poetical imagination and ready wit, enabled him at all times to
put even a known subject in a new light. Talents such as these, Mrs.
Wollstonecraft acknowledged she had never seen united in the same
person; and they accordingly made a strong impression on her mind.
"For," said she, "I always catch something from the rich torrent of his
conversation, worth treasuring up in my memory, to exercise my
understanding." She falsely reasoned with herself, and expressed to some
of her intimate friends, that although Mrs. Fuseli had a right to the
person of her husband, she, Mrs. Wollstonecraft, might claim, and, for
congeniality of sentiments and talents, hold a place in his heart; for
"she hoped," she said, "to unite herself to his mind." It was not to be
supposed that this delusion could last long. From an admiration of his
talents she became an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span> admirer of his person, and then, wishing to
create similar feelings in Fuseli, moulded herself upon what she thought
would be most agreeable to him. Change of manners, of dress, and of
habitation were the consequences; for she now paid more than ordinary
attention to her person, dressed fashionably, and introduced furniture
somewhat elegant into commodious apartments, which she took for that
purpose.</p>

<p>But these advances were not met with the affection which she had hoped
to inspire in Fuseli,&mdash;for he admired her chiefly for her talents; and
in the warmth of her disappointed feelings she constantly vented
complaints of being neglected. These availed so little, that sometimes
when Fuseli received letters from her, thinking they teemed only with
the usual effusions of regard, and the same complaints of neglect, he
would allow them to be some days unopened in his pocket.</p>

<p>The tumult which was raised in her mind by conflicting feelings, having
love for the object, and yet the wish that her affection should be so
regulated as to be strictly within the bounds which she had assigned to
love, that of "strength of feeling unalloyed by passion," injured in a
degree her health, and unfitted her for those literary pursuits which
required a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span> than ordinary exertion of the mind. For more than
twelve months "she wrote nothing but criticisms for the Analytical
Review," and even these, which required but little exertion of the
talents which she possessed, would not have been written but for her
daily necessities. Fuseli reasoned with her, but without any effect,
upon the impropriety of indulging in a passion that took her out of
common life. Her answer was, "If I thought my passion criminal, I would
conquer it, or die in the attempt. For immodesty, in my eyes, is
ugliness; my soul turns with disgust from pleasure tricked out in charms
which shun the light of heaven."</p>

<p>At length Mrs. Wollstonecraft appears to have grown desperate, for she
had the temerity to go to Mrs. Fuseli, and to tell her, that she wished
to become an inmate in her family; and she added, as I am above deceit,
it is right to say that this proposal "arises from the sincere affection
which I have for your husband, for I find that I cannot live without the
satisfaction of seeing and conversing with him daily." This frank avowal
immediately opened the eyes of Mrs. Fuseli, who being alarmed by the
declaration, not only refused her solicitation, but she instantly
forbade her the house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
No resource was now left for Mrs. Wollstonecraft, but to fly from the
object which she regarded: her determination was instantly fixed; she
wrote a letter to Fuseli, in which she begged pardon "for having
disturbed the quiet tenour of his life," and on the 8th of December,
1792, left London for France.</p>

<p>Shortly after her arrival in Paris, she again wrote to Fuseli, gave him
her opinion of the state of public feeling at that important period of
the revolution, and implored him to write to her occasionally. As this
letter was not answered, all communication on her part during her
residence abroad ceased.</p>

<p>The cause of Mrs. Wollstonecraft's protracted stay in France;&mdash;for she
intended, prior to her departure from England, to have remained there
only six weeks,&mdash;and the attachment which she formed while in Paris, are
foreign to this memoir; besides, if they were not, it would be
unnecessary now to detail them, as they have been long before the public
from the able pen of him who afterwards became her husband.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>After an absence of nearly two years and a half, Mrs. Wollstonecraft
returned to London, (in April 1795,) and on her arrival called upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Fuseli: the reception which she met with, it is presumed, was not very
grateful to her feelings, for she shortly after wrote him the following
letter.</p>

<p class="blockquot"><br />"When I returned from France, I visited you, Sir, but finding
myself after my late journey in a very different situation, I
vainly imagined you would have called upon me. I simply tell you
what I thought, yet I write not, at present, to comment on your
conduct or expostulate. I have long ceased to expect kindness or
affection from any human creature, and would fain tear from my
heart its treacherous sympathies. I am alone. The injustice,
without alluding to hopes blasted in the bud, which I have
endured, wounding my bosom, have set my thoughts adrift into an
ocean of painful conjectures. I ask impatiently what&mdash;and where
is truth? I have been treated brutally; but I daily labour to
remember that I still have the duty of a mother to fulfil.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"I have written more than I intended,&mdash;for I only meant to
request you to return my letters: I wish to have them, and it
must be the same to you. Adieu!"</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 15em;"><span class="smcap">"Mary."</span></span></p>

<p class="insmall">"Monday Morning,&mdash;To Mr. Fuseli."</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
All communication ceased between the parties from this time until after
Mrs. Wollstonecraft's marriage with Mr. Godwin. Fuseli noticed this
occurrence in a letter to a friend, in the following terms: "You have
not, perhaps, heard that the assertrix of female rights has given her
hand to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">balancier</i> of political justice."</p>

<p class="bgft">Fuseli saw Mrs. Godwin but seldom; he dined only once at her table.
Indeed, this lady did not live long to enjoy the happiness which she had
pictured to herself, in being the wife of a man of genius and talents;
for she died on the 10th September 1797, after having given birth to a
female child,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> who has proved herself, by works of the imagination,
to be worthy of her parents. Fuseli could not but feel much regret on
the occasion; but as "grief does not give utterance to words," so he
barely noticed the catastrophe in the postscript of a letter to Mr.
Roscoe, in these terms,&mdash;"Poor Mary!" </p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> Shakspeare Gallery was now (in 1790) nearly completed, and hence
Fuseli's commissions for this had ceased. The success which had attended
Boydell, in his edition of Shakspeare's works, induced Mr. Johnson to
issue proposals for publishing one of Milton, which should not only
rival this, but, in point of letterpress, designs, and engravings,
surpass any work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span> which had previously appeared in England. Cowper had
long meditated giving an edition of Milton's poetical works, with
copious notes on his English poems, and translations into verse of those
in Latin and Italian; and, indeed, he had made some progress in the
undertaking. Johnson, who was his publisher, urged him to complete it;
to which he assented, and Fuseli was engaged to paint thirty pictures,
which were to be put into the hands of the ablest engravers of the time.
Cowper proceeded with his part, and Fuseli laboured in putting upon
canvass the sublime, the pathetic, and the playful scenes in Milton.
That of "The Contest of Satan, Sin, and Death," was soon finished, and
given to Sharpe to engrave. "Eve starting from seeing herself in the
Water" was put into the hands of Bartolozzi. "Satan taking his flight
from Chaos," and "Adam and Eve observed by Satan," were ready for the
graver of Blake.</p>

<p>The serious mental indisposition of Cowper, which took place before he
had completed his part of the work, and the opposition which Mr.
Alderman Boydell offered to the progress of the scheme, thinking that it
would affect the sale of his edition of Milton, made Mr. Johnson resolve
to abandon it altogether. This undertaking of Fuseli's was, however, the
foundation of a stupendous work by him, "The Milton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span> Gallery," of which
I shall have occasion hereafter to speak, and which he appears to have
meditated in August 1790, while at Ramsgate in company with Mr. Johnson;
shortly after he began to paint for Cowper's projected edition of
Milton's poetical works, as will be shewn by the following letter
written by him to Mr. Roscoe, and to which Johnson added a postscript.</p>

<p class="inright"><br />"Ramsgate, 17th August, 1790.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
<span style="margin-left: 1em"><span class="smcap">"my dear sir,</span></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">"I did indeed receive your letter, but had not the pleasure of
seeing Mr. Daulby. The first time he called upon me, I happened
to be at dinner with some company, and as it never entered my
head the stately figure which I observed dropping from the coach
should be our friend, I ordered myself to be denied. The letter
was left, but no time mentioned when he would call again, or any
place assigned where I might find him. Johnson knew nothing of
his abode. In about eight or ten days he called again, but I was
at Woolwich: the next morning, I understand, he left town. You
both will easily believe that I was extremely mortified, not to
have had it in my power to enjoy an hour or two in his company;
but I console myself with the thought, that he spent those hours
with more satisfaction to himself.</p>

<p class="blockquot"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>"You may by this time have forgot the contents of your letter:
it contains a comparison between your pursuits and mine; and no
doubt I make the most advantageous figure on paper. I am on a
road of glory; you are only crawling about from the white to the
brown bed. I should, however, not be very uneasy if I could,
without a total change of situation, obtain a little of that
"elbow-room" for my mind, which it seems you get by moving from
a large house to a smaller one. Notwithstanding the success of
my election at the Academy, and of the pictures which I have
painted for the Shakspeare Gallery, my situation continues to be
extremely precarious. I have been and am contributing to make
the public drop their gold into purses not my own; and though I
am, and probably shall be, fully employed for some time to come,
the scheme is hastening with rapidity towards its conclusion.
"There are," says Mr. West, "but two ways of working
successfully, that is, lastingly, in this country, for an
artist,&mdash;the one is, to paint for the King; the other, to
meditate a scheme of your own." The first he has monopolized; in
the second he is not idle: witness the prints from English
history, and the late advertisement of allegorical prints to be
published from his designs by Bartolozzi. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span> imitation of <i>so
great a man</i>, I am determined to lay, hatch, and crack an egg
for myself too, if I can. What it shall be, I am not yet ready
to tell with certainty; but the sum of it is, a series of
pictures for <i>exhibition</i>, such as Boydell's and Macklin's. To
obtain this, it will be necessary that I should have it in my
power to work without commission or any kind of intermediate
gain, for at least three years; in which time I am <i>certain</i> of
producing at least twenty pictures of different dimensions. The
question is, what will enable me to live in the mean time? With
less than three hundred a-year <i>certain</i>, I cannot do it. My
idea is, to get a set of men (twenty, perhaps,&mdash;less if
possible, but not more,) to subscribe towards it. Suppose twenty
pounds each annually, to be repaid either by small pictures or
drawings, or the profits of the exhibition, should it succeed,
of which there can be no very great doubt.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Such is, at present, the rude outline of my scheme: it is in
this manner alone that I can exhibit that variety of picturesque
ideas of which, I flatter myself, you have seen specimens
amongst my productions on paper and canvass; and now, tell me
your opinion with your usual openness. I am in earnest, yours

projected; but they are trifling, when we consider what he is

On the 10th of February, 1790, Fuseli was elected a Royal Academician.
As his election was accompanied by a circumstance which caused a great
sensation at that time, (I allude to the temporary secession of Sir
Joshua Reynolds from the Royal Academy,) it will not be uninteresting to
give Fuseli's account of the transaction, which I have heard him
frequently relate.</p>

<p>The Earl of Aylesford, the intimate friend of Sir Joshua, had patronized
M. Bonomi, an Italian by birth, a native of Rome, and by profession an
architect; and, with the view of serving this gentleman, recommended him
strongly to the protection of the President of the Royal Academy.
Accordingly, in the early part of 1789, M. Bonomi became a candidate for
the preliminary step, an Associate of the Academy, in opposition to Mr.
Gilpin, well known as a landscape painter of merit, and who, for his
amiable disposition and manners, was a man much respected and esteemed.
Sir Joshua exerted his influence to secure success to M. Bonomi; but as
the number of votes for the two candidates, on the ballot, were found to
be equal, the President asserted his privilege of the casting-vote,
which he gave in favour of the architect, avowing, at the same time,
that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span> had done so with the intention of his being elected an
Academician when a vacancy should occur, and thus becoming eligible,
according to the laws of the Academy, to occupy the chair of Professor
of Perspective, which was then vacant; considering it, as he said,
highly desirable that this should be filled according to those laws, by
an Academician, and that, in his opinion, M. Bonomi was the person best
qualified for the situation. On the death of Mr. Meyer,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> which took
place early in the year 1790, M. Bonomi was accordingly proposed to
succeed him as a Royal Academician. Fuseli, who had always been treated
with great kindness by Sir Joshua, called upon him to solicit his vote
for himself. The President received him with politeness, acknowledged
the claims which he had to the distinction of an Academician, from the
great talents which he possessed, and which no man appreciated more than
himself; but he said, "Were you my brother, I could not serve you on
this occasion; for I think it not only expedient, but highly necessary
for the good of the Academy, that M. Bonomi should be elected:" and he
added, "on another vacancy, you shall have my support." Fuseli, in
answer, thanked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span> Sir Joshua for his candour, and hoped if he tried his
friends on <i>this</i> occasion, he would not be offended. To this the
President said, "Certainly not."</p>

<p>Sir Joshua was active in taking measures to favour the views of M.
Bonomi; and although he expected some opposition, from the spirit which
was manifested on the former occasion, yet he was nevertheless very
sanguine as to the ultimate success of this candidate. On the evening of
the election, an expedient was resorted to, no doubt with the sanction
of, but not acknowledged by, the President,&mdash;that of exhibiting on the
table of the Academy some neatly executed drawings of M. Bonomi; which
display had a contrary effect to what Sir Joshua expected. The friends
of Fuseli protested against this, which they deemed an innovation, and
urged with great propriety, that if drawings were to be shown, he should
have the same chance as his competitor; stating at the same time, that
his portfolio was as rich in these as any man's; "for the members," said
they, "must be aware, that no modern artist excels Mr. Fuseli in
design."</p>

<p>The sense of the meeting was taken; and after a warm debate, M. Bonomi's
drawings were ordered to be removed.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>As it was considered that Fuseli's claims had not been fairly met, those
who were wavering in opinion before, now became fixed in his favour, and
when the numbers were declared, there were twenty-one votes for, and
only nine against him. This decision was evidently unexpected by Sir
Joshua, who, on leaving the chair, shewed some degree of mortification;
and on the 23d of February, 1790, thirteen days after the election had
taken place, he wrote a letter to the Academicians, in which were these
words: "I resign the Presidency of the Royal Academy, and also my seat
as an Academician." It is unnecessary, in this place, to detail the
means which the Academy took, and successfully, to recall him to the
chair: suffice it to say, that, notwithstanding the chagrin which he
experienced, in failing to carry the point for M. Bonomi, Sir Joshua was
unaltered in his kindness to Fuseli, during the remainder of his life.</p>

<p>The employment which had been given to Fuseli by Mr. Alderman Boydell,
for the Shakspeare Gallery, enabled him to save some money; he therefore
proceeded with a degree of confidence in the great work which he had for
some years meditated, and on which he was now actively employed,&mdash;the
pictures which were to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span> form the "Milton Gallery." In aid of these
means, however, he expected to be able to maintain himself, during the
execution of the work, by painting occasionally small pictures for the
printsellers and booksellers, on whom the historical painters of this
country have principally depended for support. But in this he was in a
great measure disappointed, for his competitors in the art raised a
report, that his time was so much occupied in a scheme of such magnitude
from Milton, that he had no leisure for any other subject,&mdash;hence their
usual commissions began to decline, and at length almost ceased.</p>

<p>Fuseli felt this disappointment of his hopes, and in a letter to Mr.
Roscoe says, "I am convinced that of all the lies Nero told, that in
which he asserts art was supported by all the earth, was the most
atrocious; and although <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">laudatur et alget</i> seems to be intended for my
motto, and though despondence often invades my pillow, yet my head and
hand still keep on steady in the prosecution of my great work. May the
hope which carries me on, not prove delusive."</p>

<p>The monotony of painting from one author, however, was in a degree
broken by the variety of subjects which Milton's poetical works afford,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
for he could at will turn "from grave to gay:" this transition, Fuseli
often acknowledged, afforded him considerable relief and pleasure.</p>

<p>In the year 1793, the Rev. R. A. Bromley, rector of St. Mildred's in the
Poultry, issued proposals for publishing by subscription, two large
quarto volumes of "A Philosophical and Critical History of the Fine
Arts, more especially Painting;" and at the instance of Mr. West, the
Royal Academy subscribed for a copy. The first volume appeared early in
1794, and the author, after having discussed and criticised the works of
Michael Angelo and Raphael, thus expresses himself:&mdash;"The dignity of
moral instruction is degraded whenever the pencil is employed on
frivolous, whimsical, and unmeaning subjects. On this head, it is to be
feared, there ever will be too much cause for complaint, because there
ever will be persons incapable of solidity, although very capable of
executing this art with power: strength of understanding, and ability in
art or science, are very different things; they are derived from
different sources, and they are perfectly independent of each other. The
one can no more be instrumental to the communication of the other, than
either can communicate temper or disposition. The finest art in the
world may therefore be combined with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span> the lightest and most superficial
mind. Books are written of a light and fantastic nature by those who
cannot write otherwise, and yet will write something. And so it is with
painting; the mind of the artist can but give such subjects as are
consecutaneous to its turn.&mdash;<i>The Nightmare</i>, <i>Little Red Ridinghood</i>,
<i>The Shepherd's Dream</i>, or any dream that is not marked in authentic
history as combined with the important dispensations of Providence, and
many other pieces of a visionary and fanciful nature, are speculations
of as exalted a stretch in the contemplation of such a mind, as the
finest lessons as were ever drawn from religion, or morals, or useful
history; and yet the painter who should employ his time on such
subjects, would certainly amuse the intelligent no more than the man who
should make those subjects the topics of a serious discourse. But what
good has the world, or what honour has the art, at any time derived from
such light and fantastical speculations? If it be right to follow
Nature, there is nothing of her here,&mdash;all that is presented to us is a
reverie of the brain. If it be allowable to cultivate fancy, that which
has little or nothing of nature in its composition becomes ridiculous. A
man may carry the flights of imagination even within the walks of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
chastest art or science, till they become mere waking dreams, as wild as
the conceits of a madman. The author of Observations on <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fresnoy de Arte</i>
very properly calls these persons, 'Libertines of painting:' as there
are libertines of religion, who have no other law but the vehemence of
their own inclinations, so these have no other model, he says, but a
rodomontado genius, which shews us a wild or savage nature that is not
of our acquaintance, but of a new creation.</p>

<p>"If not in subjects altogether, yet in manner, one of the first examples
of this kind, if not the very first, appeared about the latter end of
the sixteenth century, in a Neapolitan, who is commonly known by the
name of Giuseppe d'Arpino."</p>

<p>After having thus openly condemned some of the subjects painted by Sir
Joshua Reynolds and Fuseli, the author shortly after launches out in
unqualified praise of the works of West, particularly his "Death of
Wolfe," of which he gives an elaborate description, and concludes by
considering it as "one of the most genuine models of historic painting
in the world." The series of pictures painted by Barry, which adorns the
great room of the Society of Arts in the Adelphi, are also eulogized by
him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>It was generally known to the academicians, that Mr. Bromley had
assisted Mr. West in arranging and getting up the discourses which the
latter delivered to the Royal Academy; and it was conjectured that Mr.
West had given his friend some of the observations on modern art, even
those in praise of his own works. These circumstances, and Mr. Bromley's
strictures upon a living artist (Fuseli), disgusted many of the members
of the Royal Academy, and they requested Fuseli not only to animadvert
upon them, but to prove (what he broadly asserted) that Mr. Bromley did
not understand the subject, and that he was equally ignorant of the
classical authorities which he quoted in his Dissertation upon Ancient
Art. Fuseli immediately undertook the task, and published in a journal,
a letter addressed to Mr. Bromley, pointing out a variety of errors in
his work. I regret, after having employed much industry to find this,
that I have not succeeded. Mr. Bromley answered it by publishing two
letters in the Morning Herald of the 12th and 18th of March 1794, in
which he deeply complains of the injury he sustained, as an author, by
the observations of Fuseli; admits that several of these are correct
which regard classical quotations, but shields himself by stating that
his manuscript<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span> was right, and that the errors are to be attributed to
the printer.</p>

<p>Fuseli's letter, however, made so deep an impression, that the Academy
were about to reject the book altogether, as unworthy a place in their
library; but after some debate, they came to the resolution to allow the
first volume to remain there, but to withdraw the subscription for the
second. And on the 20th of February, 1794, at a general meeting of
Academicians, they came to this resolution, "That Mr. Fuseli has
conducted himself properly in his remarks on Mr. Bromley's book." In
consequence of the opposition of Fuseli, the second volume was never
published.</p>

<p>In 1794, Fuseli painted for Mr. Seward "The Conspiracy of Catiline."
This gentleman was so much pleased with the picture, that he wrote the
following verses, which were published in the "Whitehall Evening Post,"
in the December that year, and copied into the "European Magazine, for
January 1795."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p><p>In the years 1793 and 1794, Fuseli painted four pictures for
"Woodmason's Illustrations of Shakspeare,"&mdash;two from subjects in the
Midsummer Night's Dream, and the other two from Macbeth. Three of these
are known by engravings, namely, Oberon squeezing the juice of the
flowers into Titania's eyes while she sleeps,&mdash;Titania awake, attended
by fairies, and in raptures with Bottom wearing the ass's head,&mdash;and
Macbeth meeting the Witches on the heath.&mdash;The fourth, Macbeth with the
Witches at the cauldron, was chosen by Sharpe, and some progress made by
him in the engraving of it, when the scheme was abandoned. Fuseli was
much gratified by my having subsequently purchased this picture, and
remarked, "You have another of my best poetical conceptions. When
Macbeth meets with the witches on the heath, it is terrible, because he
did not expect the supernatural visitation; but when he goes to the cave
to ascertain his fate, it is no longer a subject of terror: hence I have
endeavoured to supply what is deficient in the poetry. To say nothing of
the general arrangement of my picture, which in composition is
altogether triangular, (and the triangle is a mystical figure,) I have
endeavoured to shew a colossal head rising out of the abyss, and that
head Macbeth's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span> likeness. What, I would ask, would be a greater object
of terror to you, if, some night on going home, you were to find
yourself sitting at your own table, either writing, reading, or
otherwise employed? would not this make a powerful impression on your
mind?" Fuseli always complained of not being able to effect all he
wished in these pictures, in consequence of being limited to shape and
size, as it was stipulated by Woodmason, that those painted for his
gallery should be 5 feet 6 inches high, by 4 feet 6 inches broad.</p>

<p>It was not until his own means were exhausted that Fuseli could bring
himself to solicit pecuniary assistance from others for the
accomplishment of his plan of the "Milton Gallery." As soon, however, as
it was understood that he must either give it up, or be supported in it,
six of his intimate friends (in 1797) immediately came forward, and each
agreed to advance him fifty pounds per annum, until the task was
completed. It gives me pleasure to place the names of these gentlemen on
record. Messrs. Coutts, Lock, Roscoe, G. Steevens, Seward, and Johnson.
It was stipulated that they were to be paid out of the proceeds of the
exhibition of the Milton Gallery, or take pictures or drawings to the
value of their contributions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span> Mr. Coutts, in addition to his annuity,
with that characteristic spirit of true liberality which ever marked his
conduct, and with that modesty which generally accompanies such
feelings, made a donation of a hundred pounds, under the injunction that
his name should not appear in the transaction; and Mr. Roscoe gave
proofs of the sincere friendship which he entertained for the artist, by
not only buying pictures to a considerable amount, but also by inducing
his friends and connexions at Liverpool to make purchases. The interest
which Mr. Roscoe took in Fuseli's labours is shown in the following
letter:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot"><br /><span style="margin-left:1em;"><span class="smcap">"my dear friend,</span></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">"I am much mortified that I shall not have the pleasure of
seeing you in Liverpool; but, at the same time, if your bringing
your works before the public next Spring depends on your close
attention to them at present, it will, I confess, in a great
degree reconcile me to my disappointment. I look upon this as
the period which will shew you to the public in your true light,
and obtain for you that universal suffrage which will secure you
a great and lasting reputation. Inclosed is a bill from Clarke's
for a second hundred pounds, of which you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span> will be pleased to
acknowledge the receipt by a line, when it comes to hand. I
consider you as connected in London with friends of more
liberality than are generally met with, and I esteem you as a
cautious and provident man, for an artist; notwithstanding
which, I may be excused in suggesting to you, that this
exhibition should be wholly on your own account, and should not
be connected with any subsequent plan that may be proposed for
publication of prints from the pictures, &amp;c. With respect to the
mode of exhibiting the pictures, I still think the least
expensive will be to stucco the room with pannels, with broad
mouldings, in imitation of frames, which may be painted in a
bold style, to suit the pictures. If this could be done in
imitation of bronze, it would have a grave and better effect for
such subjects, than if you even went to the expense of gilding,
which would be enormous. I mention this, because, if you think
the plan likely to answer, the work should be done some time
before, that it may be sufficiently dry. Perhaps all this may be
unnecessary, and you have already decided on a better plan; but
I know you will attribute it to its proper motive.</p>

to nursing too long.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span> Apropos&mdash;I have just translated a poem on
this subject, in two capitoli from the Italian of Luigi
Tansillo, in which he endeavours to prevail on the ladies to
undertake that important duty to their children. Tansillo was
contemporary with Ariosto, &amp;c., and for purity of style is
excelled by few of his countrymen. I have sent my version to
Shepherd, to revise, &amp;c.; but am yet undecided whether I should
publish it.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> &mdash;Adieu, my dear friend, and believe me very
truly and affectionately yours,</p>

"<span class="smcap">W. Roscoe</span>."</span>
</p>

<p class="insmall">"Liverpool, 12th Dec. 1797."</p>

<p class="p2">The assistance afforded by these friends enabled Fuseli to carry on
steadily the grand work on which he was engaged, and to this, most
probably, the public owe many of the pictures of which the Milton
Gallery was composed. After acknowledging his gratitude to one of them
(Mr. Roscoe), he thus expresses himself, "I shall now endeavour to carry
through a work which I consider a monument of myself; whatever I may be,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magnis tamen excido ausis</i>, if I do not succeed to give it excellence."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1795, Fuseli assisted his friend Mr. Seward by contributing several
articles to an amusing and instructive work known by the appellation of
"Seward's Anecdotes."</p>

<p>In 1796, he painted a picture for Macklin's Gallery, "The Vision of the
Candlesticks," from the Revelations of St. John. For this he chose what
may be considered the most sublime moment, the sudden appearance of the
apparition and the trance of the saint; but he always regretted that he
was limited to size, and tied too much to biblical precision by Mr.
Macklin, instead of being allowed to exercise the full range of his
fancy on a canvass of larger dimensions.</p>

<p>In the autumn of this year (1796), Mr. and Mrs. Fuseli, with Messrs.
Opie and Bonnycastle, passed a few days at Windsor; the object of the
two artists was not only to have some relaxation and to see the
pictures, but to examine critically the cartoons of Raphael, which were
at this time in the Castle. An anecdote or two will show the disposition
of the three men. In their journey down by the stage-coach, they were
much annoyed by an outside passenger placing his legs over one of the
windows. Opie at first gently remonstrated with him; this, however, not
producing the desired effect, he pinched his legs, but yet the nuisance
continued; at length the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span> coach stopped at an inn. Opie, being enraged,
exerted his Herculean strength, and pulled the person to the ground; but
this did not produce any rencontre.&mdash;When at Windsor, the two painters
endeavoured to palm the Scriptural subjects of West upon Bonnycastle for
the cartoons of Raphael; but although he was not a competent judge of
works of art, yet he was too well read not to detect their intentions.
Bonnycastle, however, wished to show his critical knowledge, and
ventured upon the observation usually made on the cartoon of "The
Miraculous Draught of Fishes," that the boat was not sufficiently large
for the men, much less for the lading. Fuseli instantly answered, "By
G&mdash;d, Bonnycastle, that is a part of the miracle." Being at Windsor,
they went to Eton College: here the youths assembled about them, asking
the usual questions; "Do you wish to see the Library, Gentlemen," and
such like. Fuseli amused himself by answering them in Latin; but Opie,
in his usual gruff manner, said to the most prominent among them, "What
do you want? I cannot make out to what class of beings you belong, being
too little for a man, and too large for a monkey." This was resented as
an insult by the mass; and it was only by the great physical powers of
Bonnycastle and Opie, that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span> disengaged themselves and their
companion from the crowd of boys who surrounded them. Fuseli was highly
provoked, and was apprehensive also of personal violence; and when he
got without the barrier, almost breathless with rage, he sat on a large
stone by the side of the road and exclaimed, "I now wish I was the Grand
Sultan, for I would order my vizier to cut off the heads of these
urchins from the rising of the sun until the going down thereof."</p>

<p>By indefatigable industry, Fuseli had now made considerable progress in
the pictures which were to compose the "Milton Gallery," and those
friends, as well as many of the artists who had been allowed to see them
as he proceeded, felt confident of the ultimate success of the
exhibition. With such feelings his intimate friend Sir Thomas Lawrence
offered to contribute a picture gratuitously, and Mr. Opie tendered his
services, not only to paint some pictures, but to manage the concern;
under the condition, however, that he was to be a sharer in the profits.
These offers Fuseli politely but prudently declined, being determined
not to have any assistance whatever in a work, which he wished should be
a monument of himself, and feeling, perhaps, that contrarieties of style
would not be beneficial to the exhibition as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span> a whole; for his aim was
more to give the sublime, quiescent, and playful imagery of the poet in
his own powerful manner, than to engage attention by colour or a
brilliant execution of the pictures. These observations are not however
intended to depreciate the merits of the splendid picture painted from
Milton by Sir Thomas Lawrence, of "Satan calling up his Legions," which
for a long period was a prominent feature in the collection of his Grace
the late Duke of Norfolk, at his house in St. James's Square, and which,
by the style of drawing as well as its tone of colour, abundantly prove,
that this artist would have been equally distinguished for his powers in
treating epic subjects as in portraits, if he had employed his pencil
exclusively thereon.</p>

<p>As soon as the intended exhibition was announced by the daily prints,
but before the doors of the "Milton Gallery" were opened, the public
mind was attempted to be biassed very unfairly by paragraphs in the
newspapers calumniating the subjects as well as the execution of the
pictures. These critics considered that he had attempted to represent on
canvass scenes adapted only to poetic imagery, and thus transgressed the
limits of the imitative art, and that his figures were distorted, and
his colouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span> wanting both in force and brilliancy. As it was evident
that these observations could have proceeded only from some persons who
had seen the pictures through the kindness of the painter, Fuseli
considered his confidence betrayed and interests injured by those who
came under the mask of friendship; and he always held the opinion that
the paragraphs in question were written by or at the instance of one or
more of the then members of the Royal Academy.</p>

<p>As the mass of the public form their judgment of works of art more by
what they are told by the diurnal prints, than by what they feel or
know, there is no doubt that these unwarrantable criticisms had their
effect in checking the desire of many persons to visit the exhibition.
Fuseli, however, was sanguine as to the ultimate success of the "Milton
Gallery," for he had yet to learn that he who had delineated the sublime
and playful imagery of the poet, was like the poet himself to accomplish
his design under every discountenance, and in the end to gain little or
nothing by his performance. For, with feelings strongly in opposition to
the opinion of Dr. Johnson, that "we read Milton for instruction, retire
harassed and overburthened, and look elsewhere for recreation; we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
desert our master and seek for companions;" Fuseli wrote in large
letters in the margin of a copy of the "Lives of the Poets," now in my
possession, in allusion to the passage in question, "<span class="smcap">I do not.</span>" Some of
the judicious friends of Fuseli formed a more correct notion of the
feelings of the public than himself, and were not therefore so sanguine
as to the success of his exhibition; this is manifest by the following
letter from Mr. Roscoe.</p>

<p class="inright"><br />"Allerton, 24th May, 1799.</p>

<p class="blockquot"><span style="margin-left:1em;"><span class="smcap">"my dear friend,</span></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">"My friend and neighbour Mr. Shepherd, who is already known to
you, being about to take his departure with Mrs. Shepherd and
her sister on a journey to London, I avail myself of the
opportunity it affords of informing you, without being
questioned on the subject, that I am yet in existence, and, what
I know you will be glad to hear, in better health, and
consequently better spirits, than when I last wrote to you. From
the experience I have hitherto had of my new residence, it
promises to be productive of every advantage which I expected to
find from it:&mdash;good air, opportunity or rather necessity of
exercise, and a degree of retirement which is indispensably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
necessary to my peace of mind. The latter you will perhaps
believe when I tell you that I am a mile and a half from any
neighbour; but, at that distance, I have on every side of me
some of my most intimate and valuable friends. Such being the
advantage I enjoy here, you will not wonder that I am exerting
myself to secure the means of remaining here, without the
necessity of further interference in the tumult of the town,
which I hope in a short time I shall be able to do. I consider
it as one great secret in the art of living, especially at a
time when all the necessaries of life are so high, to obtain
subsistence immediately from the earth, and, accordingly, I am
surrounded with cows, hogs, turkies, geese, cocks, hens, and
pigeons, which, according to the good old maxim, (take, Peter,
kill and eat,) I plunder and slaughter without mercy; and shall
be very angry with you if you tell me (as is not unlikely) that
I am keeping up my paltry existence at the expense of the lives
of a number of beings, each of which is ten times happier than
myself.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"I was struck with the sight of an advertisement in the Courier,
which announced to me, in common with all the world, that the
Exhibition of the Pictures of Milton would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span> opened in a few
days. I rejoice to find your exertions so nearly brought to a
conclusion, and I hope I may say, so nearly crowned with
success. I have sometimes regretted that your intention of
painting a series of pictures from Shakspeare was frustrated;
but, after what I have seen of Milton, I am convinced that it
was he alone could have afforded sufficient scope for your
powers. I will not pretend to prophesy, <i>nor, to say the truth,
have I any very high opinion of the taste of the present day</i>;
but if the public are insensible to the feast which will now be
spread before them, I shall be wholly hopeless of their
amendment. That they will see with indifference is impossible;
and this circumstance alone is favourable, however they may be
induced to decide.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Believe me, my dear friend, I do not turn a deaf ear to the
claims you have on my friendship and affection; and if I should
be able to produce a few lines worthy of the subject, there is
nothing I should do with so much pleasure as to express the
opinion I have of your talents.</p>

In 1798, Mr. Johnson was brought to trial for selling the Reverend
Gilbert Wakefield's political works, and being found guilty was
sentenced by the Court to pay a fine to the King of £50, and to be
imprisoned in the King's Bench for nine months. Johnson employed Mr.
Erskine (afterwards Lord Erskine) as his counsel; and Fuseli, in common
with most of Mr. Johnson's friends, considered that the prosecution was
an arbitrary act on the part of the Government, because every bookseller
sold the works in question, and all with impunity, except Johnson; and
that Erskine, in his defence, lost sight of the interest of his client,
in the wish to shew his own political opinions, and to make a display of
his oratorical powers.</p>

<p>Mr. Johnson, on his removal to the King's Bench, occupied the Marshal's
house, and gave there his usual weekly dinners to literary and
scientific men. Fuseli was warned by his friends of the existence of the
Alien act, and advised not to visit a man in the King's Bench Prison who
had been so marked by the Government. But his friendship for Johnson was
greater than any prudential motives of this nature; and he therefore
visited him as frequently as he had previously done in his own house.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>The following anecdote respecting Lord Erskine, who subsequently was
intimate with Fuseli, was told me by Mr. Bonnycastle. He and Johnson
were, just previously to the trial, walking through Lincoln's Inn on
their way to dine with Fuseli, and met Erskine there accidentally, who
had several dogs with him, animals of which he was particularly fond. As
soon as he saw them, he cried out, "Johnson, I have something particular
to say to you," and then occupied him in close conversation, apart from
Bonnycastle, for nearly a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>At length Mr. Johnson took his leave; and when he joined Bonnycastle,
said, "You cannot even guess the topic of our conversation."
"Doubtless," said the latter, "your forthcoming trial." "Not a bit,"
said Johnson; "he never even alluded to it, and the time was wholly
occupied with his opinions about Brothers the Prophet, and in asking
questions respecting a book 'on the Revelations,' lately offered me for
publication."</p>

<p>When Johnson was liberated, he, Fuseli, and Mr. Sturch, went to
Liverpool together to enjoy, for three or four weeks, that relaxation
which was considered necessary for Johnson's health.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 20th of May, 1799, the rooms in Pall Mall, formerly occupied by
the Royal Academy, were opened for the exhibition of the "Milton
Gallery:" these Fuseli rented at 210<i>l.</i> per annum. This exhibition
consisted of forty pictures of different sizes; but, to give an idea of
the extent of the undertaking, the following are the dimensions of some
of the principal ones. "Satan starting from the touch of Ithuriel's
spear," and "Satan calling up his Legions," each 13ft. by 12.&mdash;"Satan
encountering Death, Sin interposing;" "Adam and Eve first discovered by
Satan;" "Satan flying up from Sin and Death in his enterprise;" and "The
Vision of Noah:" each 13ft. by 10. "Death and Sin bridging the waste of
Chaos," and "The Vision of the Lazar House," each 11ft. by 10. "The
Creation of Eve;" "Christ on the Pinnacle of the Temple;" "The Fall of
Satan;" "Adam resolved to share the Fate of Eve;" and "Eve at the Tree
of Knowledge:" each 10ft. by 7.</p>

<p>To those who had a feeling for the highest class of art, epic subjects,
treated with dramatic power, this exhibition afforded a high treat. But,
that some judgment may be formed of its extent and variety, the
following descriptive catalogue of the pictures drawn up by Fuseli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
himself, is here given, to which is added, as far as I can ascertain
them, the names of the persons in whose possession these pictures now
are.</p>

<p class="p2">The Vision of the Lazar-house was justly considered by the best judges
in the art, to be the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef-d'&oelig;uvre</i> of the Gallery. It is a
composition of seventeen figures, and parts of figures, in which the
painter creates both terror and pity in the spectator, by judiciously
excluding most of those objects represented by the poet as suffering
under bodily diseases calculated to create disgust, and confining
himself chiefly to the representation of the maladies of the mind, which
are so forcibly described by the passage,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"Demoniac Phrensy, moping Melancholy,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">"And moon-struck Madness&mdash;&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It would be a vain attempt, by words, to describe this Gallery, so as to
do justice to the grandeur of the ideas and of the drawing, more
particularly in the pictures of 'Satan calling up his Legions;' 'Satan
encountering Death, and Sin interposing;' 'Satan surprised at the ear of
Eve;' 'Death and Sin bridging of Chaos,' or, in that of 'Sin pursued by
Death;'&mdash;they must be seen to be appreciated. But Fuseli shone not only
in the grand, the sublime, and pathetic scenes, but also in the playful
ones. How rare a quality it is for the same mind to direct its efforts
to the <i>Pensieroso</i>, and, at command, to divert its attention to the
<i>Allegro</i>, and succeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span> in both!&mdash;But such were the powers of the
painter in question, as well as of the poet.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Fuseli, some of the newspapers of the day were so
inimical to this exhibition that it was difficult for him to get an
advertisement inserted, and even money would not induce the editors to
give a place to any paragraph which his friends wished to insert in its
favour. The beautiful lines (which will be found in the Appendix) from
the pen of William Roscoe, Esquire, lay in the hands of the editor of a
popular paper for some weeks before he gave them insertion.</p>

<p>The sum charged the public for viewing this Gallery was one shilling,
and for the descriptive catalogue, sixpence. The receipts of the
exhibition during the first month amounted only to one hundred and
seventeen pounds, and the two succeeding ones were each even less than
this sum; so that when it was closed, at the end of July, the whole of
the money taken at the doors was not adequate to the payment of the rent
of the premises and the expenses incurred for advertisements and
attendants. Fuseli was somewhat dismayed by this, and thus expressed
himself: "I have dreamt of a golden land, and solicit in vain for the
barge which is to carry me to its shore."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span> But the consciousness of his
own merit did not allow him to sink under the disappointment; he
determined to try the effect of another season, and laboured diligently
upon pictures to be then added to the Gallery.</p>

<p>Barry, who was at this time professor of painting to the Royal Academy,
had for a long period made himself obnoxious to the members, first by
his undeserved attacks upon the works of his earliest and best friend in
the art, Sir Joshua Reynolds, and afterwards by occasionally delivering
in his lectures the most severe criticisms upon the works of living
artists, and among others upon those of West, the then President, and
Fuseli. The latter were, however, in some degree provoked by the
frequent although just sallies of wit, which Fuseli employed on Barry's
pretensions to learning. The President and Council of the Academy
pointed out the impolicy of such proceedings, and indeed reprimanded
Barry; but this, instead of checking, had the effect of increasing the
violence of his abuse. A meeting of the whole body of the Academicians
was consequently summoned, and they not only dispossessed him of the
Chair as Professor, but expelled him the Academy. The Chair of the
Professor of Painting being by this resolution vacant, Opie intimated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
an intention of offering himself as a candidate; but, upon being told
that Fuseli intended to do the same thing, he immediately withdrew his
name, paying at the same time this merited compliment to his genius and
talents: "I would not," said he, "have surrendered my pretensions to any
other artist but Fuseli," who was therefore elected on the 29th of June
1799. The powers which he had displayed in the pictures of "The Milton
Gallery," his learning and well-known critical knowledge, were the
causes which influenced the Academicians in their choice.</p>

<p>It has been insidiously asserted, that after Fuseli left Zurich in 1779,
he was not on friendly terms with the members of his family; and that
they took little or no interest in the success of his efforts in the
Fine Arts. The following translation of a letter from his eldest
brother, Rodolph, proves the assertion to be unfounded.</p>

<p class="inright"><br />"Vienna, May 7th, 1799.</p>

<p class="blockquot"><span style="margin-left:1em;"><span class="smcap">"dearest brother,</span></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">"<span class="smcap">Benedetti</span>, the engraver, brought me last year, (in
<i>September</i>,) a letter from you, in which you assured me of your
unchanged, brotherly affection, and invited me to write to you
sometimes, and to acquaint you with an opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span> of sending
over to me some works of art. In October I answered your letter,
and named at the same time two London printsellers, with whom
the printsellers here, (Artaria and Co., and Mollo and Co.) are
in correspondence. Half a year, however, has already elapsed,
without my having heard from you. I can well understand that,
pending the great work which you have undertaken, and will, I
now hope, soon have finished, you may have had but little time
for letter-writing; but I do not ask a formal letter of you, but
only a line or two, to assure me you are well, and have not
quite forgotten me. If, therefore, your fraternal love is not
chilled, I hope to be gratified in this respect, before the
scythe overtakes me, of which, at my time of life, when we are
continually fancying we hear it behind us, one cannot be too
distrustful.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Much as I value your works of art, you must not think that what
you promised me is the occasion of my now writing. No, my dear
brother, I am not so selfish; your good health, and the success
of your great undertaking, are to me matters of far greater
concern than any works of art you could send me; and upon these
two points I beseech you to set my mind at ease, be your letter
ever so short.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The affairs of our country wear a lamentably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span> gloomy aspect;
and I much fear that our fellow-countrymen will act as
imprudently, and as awkwardly in the sequel, as they did at the
commencement of the <i>Swiss Revolution</i>, thereby drawing a
foreign power into the country. They then played a wretched
part, and I only hope they will not do the same again. I do not
know whether the new German books upon matters of art are to be
had in London, or not; if you should meet with the first part of
my Critical Catalogue of Engravings after classical masters,
peruse it with indulgence. The second part will be better
managed. In characterising Rafael, Correggio, and Titian, I have
made use of the writings of Mengs; because I know that he has
studied all his life after these three masters, and (in my
opinion) writes philosophically on their styles of art; but for
the rest, I confess, I do not consider Mengs to be that great
artist which the world makes him, as laborious study is too
evident in his works, and (according to my feeling) there is a
<i>something</i> in them of an undecided and timid character.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"We have materials here for the advancement of art, which are no
where to be had better&mdash;the Court spends (even now in war-time)
twenty-six thousand florins yearly on the Academy; we have casts
of all ancient statues of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span> importance, which were to be seen in
Rome, Florence, or Portici; also of more than a hundred of the
most beautiful busts; models of individuals distinguished for
beauty of person, taken from the life; skeletons; moveable
anatomical figures. The great rooms, like halls, are filled with
collections of these kinds; stipends, premiums are given; and,
in short, every thing that can be desired for the encouragement
of a school of art is here; and, nevertheless, hitherto without
having produced any apparent advantage; for, where there is no
susceptibility for the beautiful, every thing is to no purpose,
and will probably be always to no purpose.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Your London publications are every where held in the highest
esteem, especially on account of the elegance of their
execution, and the typographical splendour of the impressions.
But they are all so high in price, that a private individual of
moderate means cannot buy any of them, and must content himself
with looking at the best in the collections of the great and
rich.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"<i>Füger</i>, whom you may perhaps have known in Rome, is now
director of the Academy of Arts here. He has exhibited a series
of twenty designs from Klopstock's 'Messiah;' amongst which,
some of particular interest. Our engravers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span> with the exception
of Schmüzer, who has published four good prints from Rubens, are
of no importance, and are for the most part to be looked upon as
mere mechanics; and even if some of them have talent, they are
obliged to engrave from insignificant things, in order to earn
their bread.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The other day, I found many people collected before the shop of
my printseller, and staring at something in the window. I
pressed through the crowd, and found your representation of
"Hamlet's Ghost" was exposed in the window, of which all
present, each in his way, were expressing their admiration. Now
that I have prosed on to you of different things, I will spare
you any more prosing.&mdash;Farewell, and be happy, and think
sometimes, when in a good humour, of your ever-loving brother,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 27em;"><span class="smcap">"Rodolph</span>."</span>
</p>

<p class="blockquot">"If it should ever come into your head to write me a line,
direct, Füessli, on the Nienn Laurenzer-House, No. 34, on the
first floor, in <i>Vienna</i>.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"N. B.&mdash;The <i>Nienn</i> is a little river which flows by my house." </p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">The "Milton Gallery" was re-opened on the 21st of March 1800; but as it
did not attract the public, and as many of the members of the Royal
Academy lamented deeply the ill success which attended it, and
considered the apathy which was shown towards these grand specimens of
art would in the end be fatal to the progress of history painting in
this country, so they induced the Academy to which they belonged to come
to the resolution of patronizing the undertaking, which caused the
following circular to be issued:&mdash;</p>

<p class="inright"><br />"Royal Academy, May 2, 1800.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"<span class="smcap">Messrs.</span> Dance, Banks, and Opie, the Stewards, request the
favour of your company to dine with the President, Council, and
the rest of the Members of the Royal Academy, at the 'Milton

<p class="blockquot">"Tickets, price fifteen shillings, to be had at the 'Milton
Gallery,' and at the 'Freemasons' Tavern,' till Saturday, the
10th of August. Any Member desirous of introducing a friend, may
be accommodated with a ticket for that purpose.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The favour of an answer is desired as soon as possible." </p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">This dinner was numerously attended; the seven pictures which had been
added to those of the last exhibition were much admired; but all that
Fuseli got on the occasion, to use his own terms, was "mouth honour."

<p class="p2">As an exhibition opened for the second time has not the charm of novelty
to attract the public; so, unfortunately, at its close the Milton
Gallery, notwithstanding the patronage of the Royal Academy, was found
to be even less productive during this than the previous season; and
after four months of anxiety and disappointment, Fuseli closed it on the
18th of July 1800. Thus terminated the exhibition of one of the greatest
efforts of genius ever executed by one artist. It is lamentable to
contemplate that, after the labour of so many years, the energies
exerted by the painter, and the privations which he endured during the
time he was executing these pictures, they should have been met with so
much of neglect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span> from the public<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>. Upon the closing of this Gallery,
Fuseli thus expressed himself to a friend, "I am fed with honour, and
suffered to starve, if they could starve me."</p>

<p>Fuseli sometimes lounged about the Milton Gallery to hear the critical
and other remarks of the visitors. On one occasion, a coarse-looking man
left his party, and coming up to him, said, "Pray, Sir, what is that
picture?" Fuseli answered, "It is the bridging of Chaos: the subject
from Milton."&mdash;"No wonder," said he, "I did not know it, for I never
read Milton, but I will."&mdash;"I advise you not," said Fuseli, "for you
will find it a d&mdash;d tough job."</p>

<p>His friends felt in how embarrassed a situation Fuseli must be placed by
these unsuccessful exhibitions; and they determined to relieve him by
becoming purchasers of some of the pictures. The Countess of Guilford
bought the "Lycidas;" Lord Rivers, "Satan calling up his Legions;" Sir
Mark Sykes, Bart., "The Lubbar Fiend;" Thomas Coutts, Esq., "The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span> Lazar
House;" John Julius Angerstein, Esq. (at the recommendation of W. Lock,
Esq.) "Satan starting from the touch of Ithuriel's spear;" "The Vision
of the Deluge," and "Eve, newly created, led to Adam;" William Young
Ottley, Esq., "Sin pursued by Death," and "The Dream of Eve;" and
William Roscoe, Esq. with that friendship and liberality which he always
exercised towards Fuseli, purchased pictures to the amount of £300;
which, however, did not form a part of this exhibition.</p>

<p>Prior to the purchase of the picture of "The Deluge," by Mr. Angerstein,
Fuseli wrote the following letter to Mr. William Lock.</p>

<p class="inright"><br />"London, 11th August, 1800.</p>

<p class="blockquot"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">"<span class="smcap">As</span></span> it may be expected, and indeed necessary, that I should
inspect, and perhaps correct the pictures sent under Mr. Wyall's
direction to Mr. Angerstein's, I take the liberty of applying
through you to Mr. Lock, to be informed when my admission for
that purpose may be attended with the least inconvenience to Mr.
Angerstein's arrangements.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The greater part of my exhibition, the rejected family of a
silly father, are now again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span> rolled up, or packed together

in possession of his wish; I have been punished by obtaining
mine. It cannot be supposed, however, that I should be quite
indifferent to the fate of my bantlings; and as 'the
expectations of ignorance are indefinite,' I venture to ask,
whether you think it quite impracticable to persuade Mr.
Angerstein to find a place for 'The Deluge?' It is not quite so
wide as the smaller picture in his possession; and though, if
placed on the other side of the Satan, it would be less
honourable to me than the company of Rubens; it would be more in
tune with the rest.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"It would be presumption in me, without authority from you, to
congratulate you on what more than rumour has told me, of your
intended change of state: of this, however, you are sure, that
nothing conducive to the happiness of William Lock can be more
interesting to any man than his</p>

<p class="insmall">"To Henry Fuseli, Esq." </p>

<p class="p2">These lectures Fuseli published in the month of May 1801, in a quarto
volume, which was dedicated to his friend, William Lock, Esq. of Norbury
Park. As they have been long before the Public, it is unnecessary now to
speak of their merit; suffice it to say, that they have been translated
into the German, French, and Italian languages.</p>

<p>The publication of Fuseli's lectures having made a great sensation among
artists, and that on ancient art in particular having been much
canvassed by them as well as by antiquaries, he wished to gain, and, if
he saw fit, to embody in future editions, as much information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span> as could
be obtained on this subject; he therefore made application to his friend
the late Sir Henry Englefield, Bart. for his observations upon the Vases
of the ancients, commonly called Etruscan, which that gentleman gave him
in the following letter:</p>

<p class="inright"><br />"Tilney Street, August 24, 1803.</p>

<p class="blockquot"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">"<span class="smcap">dear sir</span>,</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">"<span class="smcap">At</span> your desire, I communicate to you such observations on the
ancient Vases, commonly called Etruscan, as a minute examination
of many of the finest specimens in the magnificent collection of
Mr. Thomas Hope, and the select and very beautiful one belonging
to Mr. Edwards, have enabled me to make, particularly with
respect to the mechanical process used in the decoration of
them.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The material of these vases is clay of a very fine and close
quality, extremely light, and of a colour nearly the same in
all, a light and agreeable orange red.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"They all, without exception, are covered with a varnish or
glazing of a dark colour, but not in all of the same tint; in
some, it has a greenish hue, and a lustre of a metallic
appearance; this is most striking in those found near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span> Nola. In
many, the varnish is of a brown black, like asphaltum.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The vases may be ranked in four classes.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"1. Those covered with varnish without ornament or painting of
any kind.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"2. Those which bear on the natural ground of the ware, figures
in black varnish.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"3. Those whose figures are left in red, the vase being covered
with varnish.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"4. Vases covered entirely with varnish, on which ornaments are
painted in colours.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Of the first sort it will be necessary to say but little. Many
of the most exquisitely formed Nolan vases are of this sort. The
varnish appears to have been laid on while the vase was on the
lathe. The parallel strokes visible on the surface of the
varnish, and its extreme equality of tint, prove this. No better
mode can be devised for varnishing, except dipping the ware into
the liquid varnish; and this was not done in these vases, as the
varnish never covers the hollow of the foot, nor descends deep
within the neck. I cannot at all say whether the vase was
varnished while yet wet, or first suffered to dry, or even baked
a first time, as is the process in much of our common modern
glazed earthenware.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The second sort bear in general marks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span> the most remote
antiquity. The figures are universally of a stiff and meagre
form, the drapery close, and the folds few and hard. Yet in many
the composition is good, and the action of the figures vigorous.
They exactly resemble in style the bronzes still remaining of
Etruscan work.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The mode pursued in painting them was this:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The intended figure was painted without any previous
discoverable outline in varnish, and then resembled exactly
those figures so common under the name of Silhouettes. When the
varnish was quite dry and hard, the features, the limbs, and the
folds of the drapery, &amp;c. were scratched through it with a
pointed tool, which was applied with such force as to cut some
depth into the clay of the vase. This sort of outlining was
sometimes carried round parts of the contour, which appeared to
the artist not sufficiently distinct without it. The hands and
fingers are often thus partially scratched out. Parts of the
drapery and ornaments on the heads of the figures were then
covered with a coat of coloured paint. Violet occurs most
frequently; often a green, and sometimes white. In some vases of
the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span> ancient and rudest appearances, animals, particularly
birds, are coloured not only with these colours, but also red
and yellow; and the appearance and style of these vases have a
great resemblance to the Egyptian paintings on their mummy
chests. The vases of this sort are said to be universally found
in the deepest graves, so deep indeed, that over them sepulchral
chambers of a later date, with vases of a totally different
character are often found. That the colours above-mentioned were
put on after the outline was scratched in, is ascertained by the
circumstance of the colours having in many instances run into,
and partially filled up, the strokes engraved in the vases. This
species of painting is evidently the first improvement on the
simple Skiagrams.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The vases of the third description, namely those whose figures
are left in red, on a ground of dark varnish, are by much the
most common of any, and are found of all degrees of excellence,
from the most careless and slight finishing, to the most
exquisite work; but in all, the style of design is essentially
different from those described above, with the figures in black.
In the red figures, however negligently executed, there is a
fulness of form,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span> and a freedom of drapery perfectly similar to
the remains of Greek art which have reached us, whether in
sculpture or coins.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The process also of this execution is entirely different from
the second sort, and will be now minutely described from
repeated observations of many of the most exquisite of them,
made not only with the naked eye, but with glasses of high
magnifying power.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The first thing painted on these vases was an outline of the
figures, not only of their contour, but the markings of the
features, muscles, folds of the drapery, ornaments, &amp;c. This
outline, in those vases which are of fine execution, was made
with an instrument which carried a very fine and equal point,
and at the same time left a very full body of the colour used on
the vase. The colour itself appears to have been of a thick
consistence; for if the strokes, even the finest, (which are as
fine as could be made by a good pen,) are carefully examined
with a magnifier in a side light, it will be distinctly
perceived that there is a slight hollow in the middle of each,
owing to the colour having flowed round the point which traced
it, and met behind it,&mdash;just as we see in a road where the mud
is of a semi-fluid consistence, that the track of a wheel is
filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span> in with the pasty mire, leaving a depressed line in the
centre of the rut.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"It is impossible to say whether the instrument used for these
outlines was of the nature of a pen or a brush; yet I am
inclined to think from the flowing appearance of the lines, that
a firm and finely pointed brush or pencil was used. Whichever it
was, the hands which guided it possessed a steadiness and
freedom of execution, almost incredible. Lines of a great length
and difficult curvatures are carried over the convex surface of
the vases, without the least wavering or indecision, or any
lifting the point from the vase, or any repetition, or filling
up of the stroke. An attentive examination of the outline will
ascertain this fact beyond a doubt, and a further proof of it
may be drawn from the few instances in which strokes of very
great length have been done at twice, particularly in a vase of
great size and admirable execution in the collection of Mr.
Hope, representing probably the story of Triptolemus, where the
long parallel lines marking the feathers of the wing of a Genius
have been suspended about half way; and no particular care has
been taken to conceal the junction of the lines.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"This vase also furnishes a very rare and instructive instance
of what, by artists, are called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span> <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">pentimenti</i>, or changes of
design. The wheel of a chariot and part of the arms of a figure,
with a patera or cup in the hand, have been considerably varied;
and the first outline is still visible like a faint red chalk
stroke, but without any appearance of enlargement or smearing,
so that it should seem that the false stroke was scraped off by
a sharp edge, carefully applied to the surface of the vase when
the varnish or paint was nearly dry.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"That the outline was performed with this freedom and celerity,
and scarcely ever altered, may be further inferred, from the
great inaccuracies of drawing so frequent even in those vases
whose design and execution are of the very highest class.
Perhaps an absolutely unerring precision of hand has never been
the lot of any artist, however excellent. The drawings of the
greatest masters prove that they found many things to alter in
their most careful first lines; and the union of excellence and
defect on the vases can, I think, only be accounted for in the
supposition of an unaltered line.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"What has been hitherto said of the mode of outlining this sort
of vases is applicable only to the finish of them. In those of
inferior finish, the outlines are much thicker, and laid on with
a less body of colour; and in many of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span> the coarsest, there is
reason to think that no outline at all was made, but that the
figures were merely left red in the general wash of the vase,
with the dark-coloured varnish, and the outlines of the
features, folds of the drapery, &amp;c. were put in with a large
brush, and in a very careless manner. Indeed, on the very finest
of the vases, the subordinate decorations, such as the
honeysuckle (as it is called) ornament so frequent under the
handles, were simply left red in the general wash of varnish
over the body of the vase; at least no outline of them is now
discoverable. To return to the painting of the finest vases. The
outline already described being perfectly dry, the artist with a
brush or other similar instrument which bore a full body of
colour and made a stroke of about a quarter of an inch in
breadth, went carefully round the contours of the outlined
figures. In this operation, an opportunity was given to make
slight alterations in the design, and in some degree to amend
the contour. This seems to have been often done; for the
original outline is often covered in parts by this wash, and
appears projecting from the surface of the vase under it;
affording also a proof that the outline was dry and hard before
this wash was laid on. Frequently, also, this wash does not
come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span> quite up to the original outline; but in general the wash
follows the outline in a most steady and masterly manner.
Probably at this time the hair of the figures was put in with a
thin wash of the same varnish or colour, managed with peculiar
freedom and dexterity, and so washed out to nothing at the
extremities of the flowing curls of the tresses, as to have the
lightest and at the same time the most finished effect. It is to
be observed that the hair, which in some parts is as dark as the
ground of the vase, is not carried quite to the ground, but that
a small space is left red round the hair, in order to relieve it
from the ground of the vase.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The truth of the contour being thus secured by this narrow
border of ground carefully laid on the covering, the remaining
surface of the vase with its varnish, might be safely entrusted
to an inferior hand. That the varnish was laid on at twice, is
evident by inspection of any well-finished vase, where the first
narrow line of varnish is distinctly visible under the general
wash.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"This process finished the greater part of the vases, even the
finest; but on some, particularly those of the largest size,
when every thing else was quite dry, some parts of the design
were coloured with washes of two different tints.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span> The horses
and parts of the armour are painted with white, which when dry
is opaque, but when wetted becomes nearly transparent. Parts of
the drapery and ornaments round the necks and on the heads of
the figures, and some of the shields, are painted yellow, and
several small flowers and ornaments of foliage, which are
interspersed among the figures, are painted in white and yellow.
The internal outlines and muscles of the horses are painted with
lines of a light orange on the white; and the white shields are
ornamented in the same manner. That the white horses were
painted after the original black outline of the human figures
was dry, is evidently seen in the magnificent vase in the
possession of Mr. Edwards. In that vase a leg of one of the
horses comes across the thigh and drapery of a figure, and the
original outline of that figure is visible under the white
colour which forms the horse's leg. All these colours are so
fixed on the vases, probably by fire, that they resist the
action of aquafortis.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The vases of the last sort, namely, those which have ornaments
in white and other colours painted on a black ground, which
covered the whole surface of the vase, are very rarely to be met
with. Mr. Hope possesses several,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span> which Sir William Hamilton
told me were all found in one sepulchral chamber, in which none
of any other sort were placed. The cause of this singularity it
were vain to enquire. No figures are represented on these vases,
but the ornaments are light wreathes of ivy, or vine-leaves,
with masks and other bacchanalian symbols. The execution is
careless, but spirited; the paint used seems of the same quality
with that above described as covering the horses, &amp;c. in vases
of the third sort; and the mode of applying it appears in no
wise to differ from what would be now pursued. It is not,
therefore, necessary to say any thing further on this subject.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"It is singular that on vases so profusely adorned with
painting, scarcely an instance of any thing like bas-relief or
sculpture of any kind occurs; on the handles of Mr. Edwards's
great Vase, two full faces in very flat relief are seen; but,
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">con rispetto parlando</span>, is it quite certain that these handles
are entirely ancient?</p>

<p class="blockquot">"These are the observations which a very careful examination has
enabled me to make on the mechanical process used in adorning
the ancient earthern Vases called Etruscan. To your judgment,

<p class="insmall">"To Henry Fuseli, Esq. R. A." </p>

<p class="p2">Early in the year (1801) Fuseli was much dejected by the intelligence of
the death of his old and esteemed friend and fellow-student, Lavater.
This singular man fell a sacrifice to what he considered his clerical
duty; for, when Zurich was occupied by the French, in an attempt to
afford consolation and alleviation to the sufferings of his townsmen,
which usually accompany the presence of an invading army, he was stabbed
by the bayonet of a soldier, under which wound he languished for some
months, and closed a valuable and useful life on the 2nd of January,
1801.</p>

<p>The treaty of peace which was signed at Amiens in 1802, afforded the
English an opportunity of visiting France, and examining those treasures
of art which Buonaparte had torn by violence from Italy, Germany, and
Holland, when those countries were subjected to him, in consequence of
the conquests of the French armies. Fuseli being determined to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span> view
them, went to Paris, accompanied by some friends, with the intention
also of collecting materials for publishing, for the information of
travellers, a critical account of the principal pictures and statues
which then adorned the Louvre. The party consisted of Mr. Farington,
R.A. Mr. James Carrick Moore, Mr. Halls a young artist, and himself.</p>

<p>Urgent business compelled Mr. Moore to return to London earlier than he
had anticipated; but the remainder of the party passed six weeks in
Paris, during the months of September and October, whence Fuseli wrote
to Mr. Moore the following letter:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot"><br /><span style="margin-left: 2em;">"<span class="smcap">dear moore</span>,</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">"<span class="smcap">I had</span> once a valuable friend in the Rev. Mr. Whalley, who took
great pains to improve me by his correspondence; he was able at

been fuller of news than observations&mdash;you would be mistaken;
they were essays crammed with trite observations, such as

<p class="insmall">"10 Vendemiaire, in Christian,<br />
2d October, 1802."<br />
</p>

<p class="blockquot">"I have not yet heard from my wife: if you should be led by your
calls into the neighbourhood of Queen Anne-street, and would
tell them I am coming, you will do a kind thing." </p>

<p class="p2">The society of Fuseli, while he was in Paris, was courted by the
principal painters of the French school. David, whom he had known at
Rome, paid him much attention, and wished to introduce him to the First
Consul; this he however declined,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span> as well as many other civilities
which this eminent painter offered, for he frequently said, "When he
looked at David, he could never divest his mind of the atrocities of the
French Revolution, nor separate them from the part which he had then
acted, for they were stamped upon his countenance."<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Gerard also
showed Fuseli great respect, and on every occasion expressed a high
admiration of his genius.</p>

<p>Every one who visits the galleries of the Louvre to examine its pictures
and statues critically and with care, is convinced that much of their
effect is lost (particularly that of the pictures) in consequence of its
being generally lighted on each side by windows, and only a small
proportion of the picture-gallery by sky-lights. Fuseli, who had seen
and recollected most, if not all, of the celebrated pictures, of the
Italian schools in particular, in the churches or palaces for which they
were painted, and to which the artists had accommodated their light and
shadow, was particularly struck with the difference in their effect, and
deplored their removal. He likewise perceived with great regret, the
injury which they had sustained and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span> were sustaining from the hands of
the French picture-cleaners, or, as they are generally called,
picture-restorers; and that, among others, the celebrated
"Transfiguration," by Raphael, although it had suffered less than most,
was in some degree impaired.</p>

<p>As the peace between England and France was of short duration, one of
the objects of Fuseli's visit was lost, and his observations on the
works of art then in the Louvre were not therefore published. The
memoranda which he made were afterwards incorporated either in his
"Lectures on Painting," in his "Fragment of a History of Art," or in the
observations on the works of artists, in his editions of "Pilkington's
Dictionary of Painters."</p>

<p>In the year 1803, he gave a picture to "The Union" Society at Liverpool:
which he presented to the members, to use his own words, "as a trifling
pledge of gratitude to a country which has reared the humble talents
which I possess." Mr. Roscoe acknowledged the receipt of this picture by
the following letter:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot"><br /><span style="margin-left: 1em;">"<span class="smcap">my dear friend</span>,</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">"<span class="smcap">I have</span> waited, day by day, for the last month, in expectation
of either seeing you or hearing from you; and my patience being
now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span> quite exhausted, I can no longer refrain from enquiring
what can be the reason of this alteration, or, at least, long
protraction, of your intended visit to this place.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"In my last, I endeavoured to express the pleasure I felt in the
hope of seeing you so soon, and only requested that I might have
a line before you left London, that I might arrange matters
(being now a man of business) so as to enjoy as much of your
company as possible. We are now near the middle of November; the
fine weather leaving us, and winter fast approaching; yet I
still flatter myself that I may see you, and shall do so, till I
hear from you to the contrary. Why not spend your Christmas with
us, when days are short, and little professional time can be
lost by it? At all events, let me <i>hear</i> from you, that I may
either continue to enjoy the hope of seeing you, or reconcile
myself as well as I can to my disappointment.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"It is now two or three weeks since the large case of pictures
came safe to hand; "The <i>Union</i>" is placed in its proper
station, where it has an uncommonly fine light, and looks
extremely well. The printer of one of our papers wants to say
something fine about it, and has called upon me for a
description. Can you suggest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span> what I shall say as to the
<i>allegorical</i> part of it, or shall I try to do the best I can,
both with respect to that and the execution? which could not
have been more suitable, or had a better effect, if you had seen
the place. I know no method that would have so direct a tendency
to encourage the high style of painting in this country, as the
introduction of good pictures into public buildings, and even
churches; on which last subject, I hope to show you some
remarks, which will appear in my Life of Leo X. now almost ready
for the press. I allow this would be little satisfaction to the
artist, if he was to give his time, talents, canvass, and paint,
as some people do. You and I will, however, settle this point, I
doubt not, to our mutual satisfaction.</p>

<p class="p2">In order to give some notion of Fuseli's projected work, for which
chiefly he went to Paris, the following criticisms upon some of the
pictures then in the Gallery of the Louvre may be acceptable: these he
was kind enough to offer to me when I was about to visit France in the
year 1814.</p>


<h4><br />JULIO ROMANO&mdash;THE CIRCUMCISION.</h4>

<p class="blockquot">This picture, which is known from the print published in Crozat,
deserves rather to be considered as a curiosity than as the work
of a great master; its composition bears some resemblance to the
cartoon of "Peter and John healing the Lame Man," of Raphael;
but the simplicity and dignity of the master are lost in the
crowd with which the pupil surrounded the ceremony. Though the
columns occupy full as much space, and are as prominent and as
full of ornament in the cartoon as in the picture, and although
the principal actors are placed in both between them, they are
not perceived in the work of Raphael, till we have witnessed the
miracle, whilst in that of Julio, they lead us to the ceremony,
which eclipses the actors in its turn.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>


<h4><br />PAOLO VERONESE.</h4>

<p class="blockquot"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">
1. The Nuptials of Cana.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">2. The Feast of Levi the Publican.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">3. The Madonna, St. Jerome, &amp;c.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">4. The Martyrdom of St. George.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">5. Jupiter launching his Thunder on the Crimes.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">6. Christ carrying his Cross.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">7. The Crucifixion.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">8. The Pilgrims of Emaus.</span>
</p>

<p class="blockquot">The two first, the third, and last of these pictures, are
perhaps the fullest models of that ornamental style by which a
great critic has discriminated the Venetian from the rest of
Italian styles,&mdash;"monsters to the man of native taste, who looks
for the story, for propriety, for national, unartificial
costume,&mdash;mines of information to the student and the masters of
art." The most technic comprehension of a magnificent whole, and
supreme command over the infinite variety of its parts, equal
suavity, energy, and ease of execution, go hand in hand with the
most chaotic caprice in the disposition and the most callous
tyranny over the character of the subject. Whatever relates to
the theory of colours, of solid, middle, and aërial tints, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
the opposition of hues warm or cold, and the contrast of light
and dark masses, is poised here with prismatic truth; the whole
is a scale of music. It is more by following the order of nature
and of light in the disposition of the whole, that Paolo
attained that illusion, which approaches to deception, than by
the attempt of making <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fac similes</i> of the parts. He knew that
dark, juicy, and absorbent colours come forward, that white
recedes, and that the middle parts partake of both, and hence,
uniting the two extremes by the intermediate tint, he obtained
that superior harmony on which the Venetian school rests its
superiority of colour, and which Rubens sought with unequal
success in the capricious disposition of a nosegay or a bunch of
flowers.</p>


<h4><br />THE MADONNA OF FOLIGNO&mdash;RAPHAEL.</h4>

<p class="blockquot">None who has seen this picture at Foligno, will recognize it
here. Whatever praise the ingenious and complicated process of
restoration may deserve, that of having restored to the picture
its original and primitive tone makes certainly no part of it:
as well might the ingredients of a dish ready-dressed by a <i
lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">restaurateur</i> of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Palais Royal</i>, be
said to resemble the unprepared viands of which it is composed.
I am far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span> from ascribing the want of resemblance to the
restoration; it could only give what remained&mdash;the bleak crudity
of its aspect. The comparative imbecility of some of its parts
accuse another hand that succeeded.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Pictures <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex voto</i> can
claim little merit from composition. "The Madonna" of Foligno,
and the "St. Cecilia" of Raphael; the "St. Sebastian" of Titian,
&amp;c. are discriminated from each other by little else than by a
more or less picturesque conception of the ground on, or before
which the figures are placed: it is expression, therefore, which
makes their chief merit, and this is the great loss which we
have suffered in the "Madonna of Foligno." Neither the "St.
John," the "St. Jerome," nor the head of "St. Francis,"
acknowledge the hand, the eye, or the feelings of Raphael. The
"St. John," though perhaps not even in its original state
sufficiently dignified, is become a savage, and what is worse, a
French one. The "St. Francis," and "St. Jerome," have been
tinted into insipidity; but the head of "Sigismond Conti," the
"Madonna and Child," appear to have suffered less, and the
angelic countenance of "The Cherub with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span> Tablet," beams with
its primitive radiance the impasto of Raphael.</p>


<h4><br />RAPHAEL WITH HIS <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">MAITRE D'ARMES</span>.</h4>

<p class="blockquot">Tradition has persevered to give this admirable picture, known
from the print in Crozat, to Raphael. It does not, however,
require more than a comparison with his other portraits, from
the first to that of Leo the Tenth, to see that the donation is
gratuitous; if it were to be given to any other master,
Giorgione has undoubtedly the first claim upon it, and there is
no known work of his which can dispute its precedence, though it
agrees with them in style. That conscious purity of touch which,
exclusively, scorns all repetition, visible chiefly in the nose
and nostrils of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maitre d'Armes</span>, the unity of tone in the
whole of the colour, and that breadth, which, without impairing
the peculiarity of character or the detail, presents the whole
at once,&mdash;dualities never attained by the dry and punctiliory
Roman principles, speak a Venetian pencil. The forefinger of the
right arm is perhaps not designed, or foreshortened, with the
energy or correctness which might be expected from the boldness
of the conception, or from the power of either Raphael or
Giorgione: but the character of the hand as well as its colour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
is in unison with the head. Why the principal figure should be
called a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maitre d'Armes</span> is not easily conceived; it is certainly
the most important of the two, and the leading figure of the
picture. The second, although full-faced, is subordinate, and
can by no courtesy of physiognomy be construed into the head of
Raphael, unless the heads in the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tribuna</span> at Florence, in this
gallery, in Vasari, in the school of Athens, &amp;c.; as well as the
head of the figure wrapped in a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ferrajuolo</i>, and sitting in a
painter's study, as meditating, by M. Antonio, be spurious. It
bears indeed some resemblance to a head etched by W. Hollar, and
subscribed with his name; but the authority on which that
appellation rests, is too futile to be admitted.</p>


<h4><br /><span class="smcap">JOHN AB EYCK.</span></h4>

<p class="blockquot">If these be the works of John ab Eyck, there is not only an
additional proof, that he could not be the inventor of
oil-painting, but likewise that, for near a century after him,
the colour of the Flemings continued in the same retrograde
taste which checked the Italian design, from the time of Lorenzo
Ghiberti to that of Leonardo da Vinci. The pictures here
exhibited as the works of Hemelinck, Metsis, Lucas of Holland,
Albert Durer, and even Holbein,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span> are inferior to those which are
ascribed to Eyck, in colour, execution, and taste. Compared with
their composition, the pictures of Andrea Mantegna are nearly
reduced to apposition; and the draperies of the three figures on
a gold ground, especially that of the middle figure, could not
be improved in simplicity or elegance by the taste of Raphael
himself. These three figures, indeed, are in a style far
superior to the rest; but even these, whether we consider each
figure individually, or relatively with each other, their
masses, depth, and relief, cannot be surpassed by those which
are ascribed to the German, Dutch, and Flemish masters of the
succeeding century. The three heads of God the Father, the
Virgin, and St. John the Baptist, are not inferior in roundness,
force, or sweetness, to the heads of Leonardo da Vinci, and
possess a more positive principle of colour; the harmony of <i
lang="it" xml:lang="it">chiar' oscuro</i>, at which Leonardo aimed,
admitted of no variety of tints than what might be obtained by
the gradation of two colours. His carnations appear to have been
added by glazing; such is the head of Mona Lisa.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>


<h4><br />PHILIPP DE CAMPAGNE&mdash;THE VISION OF ST. AMBROSE.</h4>

<p class="blockquot">The title of this picture is not accurate. It is an intermediate
figure of Apostolic gait, and in garments of legendary colours,
that shews the saints arrayed in white, who themselves seem less
occupied by the errand for which they came, than by the place
which they had left. Whatever in this picture is not vision is
admirably toned, solemn, dim, and yet rich, the colours of a
sacred place, and cloistered, devout meditation. Of these, St.
Ambrose himself partakes; but the Apostle who addresses the
Bishop, and the two Saints themselves, are by far too ponderous,
and their outlines far too much defined for celestial beings,
and for the clouds on which they are placed: their drapery,
although admirably folded, recalls in the saints too strongly
marble, and in the Apostle too palpably reality.</p>


<h4><br />A DEAD CHRIST.</h4>

<p class="blockquot">This figure, which has much of the genuine stern Italian colour,
resembles the Dead Christ, as he is called, in the library at
Basle by Holbein, in attitude perhaps,&mdash;is inferior to it in
truth, but certainly much superior in style:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span> it has much of
Carravaggio; the head in shade has a mysterious effect, but the
fore-part of the arm with the hand wants the rigid truth of the
Italian master whom he seems to have imitated.</p>


<h4><br />LE BRUN&mdash;THE DEATH OF CATO.</h4>

<p class="blockquot">The countenance of this figure is as unlike Cato, as the style
of colour is to all other works of Le Brun: it is a common man
with a beard, powerfully drawn, and painted in an austere
Italian tone.</p>


<h4><br />NICHOLAS POUSSIN.</h4>

<p class="blockquot">From the extensive list exhibited, we shall select four to make
a few characteristic observations&mdash;"The Martyrdom of St.
Erasmus," formerly an altar-piece at St. Peter's in Rome; "The
Philistines struck by the Plague;" "The Death of Saphira;" and
"Winter, or the Deluge."</p>

<p class="blockquot">The actual martyrdom of St. Erasmus is one of those subjects
which ought not to be told to the eye&mdash;because it is equally
loathsome and horrible; we can neither pity nor shudder; we are
seized by qualms, and detest. Poussin and Pietro Testa are here
more or less objects of aversion, in proportion to the greater
or less energy they exerted. This is the only picture of Poussin
in which he has attempted to rival his Italian competitors on a
scale of equal magnitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span> in figures of the size of life; and
here he was no longer in his sphere; his drawing has no longer
its usual precision of form, it is loose and Cortonesque; his
colour on this scale has neither the breadth of fresco, nor the
glow, finish, or impasto of oil.</p>

<p class="blockquot">In "The Plague of the Philistines," he has again laid too great
a stress on objects of aversion;&mdash;instead of the effects of
infection, he has personified the effluvia of putrefaction; he
has indeed discriminated his story from all others of the same
species, by the introduction of the mice, the temple of Dagon,
the arch, and the fall and fragments of the Idol: and the
variegated bustle of the colours is covered by that frowning
tone, which ought to preside where "Jove hangs his planetary
plague into the murky air."</p>

<p class="blockquot">In "The Death of Saphira" it is unnecessary to treat here what
has been observed in another place,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> that it is neither told
with perspicuity nor adequate dignity. We shall only observe,
that if the drawing and drapery of his figures be in his best
style, the colour is in his worst. It presents to the eye
neither light nor shade, and might furnish a definition of tints
that never ought to approach each other. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span> austerity of
unbroken colour which has been considered as a characteristic of
the Roman school to which Poussin properly belonged, and of
which the best specimen is given in the Transfiguration, admits
of an euphony unattainable by the dim crudity adopted by Poussin
in this picture.</p>

<p class="blockquot">For all the aforegoing defects, the last picture to be noticed,
"The Winter, or Deluge," makes up twenty degrees, which, in
every requisite of real painting, places Poussin in the first
rank of art. It is easier to feel than to describe its powers;
it is, compared with the former, the most palpable part of the
astonishing difference of effect between the works of the same
man when inspired by sentiment or suggested by cold reasoning.
What we see before us is the element itself, and not its image;
its reign is established, and by calm degrees ingulphs the
whole; it "mocks the food it feeds on." Its lucid haze has shorn
the sun of his beams; Hope is shut out, and Nature expires.</p>


<h4><br />A. VANDYCK.&mdash;LA MÈRE DE PITIÉ.&mdash;ST. MARTIN, &amp;c.</h4>

<p class="blockquot">"The Mother of Pity" appears to me the most impressive of
Vandyck's pictures in point of expression.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span> The face of the
mother, though not ideal, has elegance, and grief tempered by
dignity. The Christ, extended from her lap, has less of attitude
than his other Christs, and a truer colour. The bodies of the
dead Christs of Vandyck, in general, appear rather transparent,
silver leaf over some dark substance, and sometimes, especially
in the legs, resemble some stained marble more than a body: but
here we see real substance, a frame of flesh forsaken by
circulation: it seems an imitation of the Christ of Caravagio,
but handled with greater delicacy. The whole would, in my
opinion, have possessed greater pathos, and perhaps produced a
stronger effect, had he sacrificed the Angel and St. John to the
solitary group of the Mother and Son.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The composition of St. Martin resembles that of Albert Durer.
The countenance of St. Martin is not that of a man who will
readily part with his own comforts to alleviate the sufferings
of others. That of his companion has more mind, more dignity,
and better forms. The paupers are excrescences of deformity; but
in colouring, the picture unites every power of Vandyck and of
Rubens, in a very high degree.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">"Charles the First, &amp;c." This picture may be considered in two
different lights; as a picturesque composition, and as a
representation of character. In the first, there cannot perhaps
be conceived a more happy combination of the different
materials, whose concurrence is required to constitute a
harmonious whole. Nothing can surpass the comprehension which
balances its masses of light and shade, equally lucid and juicy,
deep and aërial, various and united; its colour at once soothes
and invigorates our eye; but when we recover from the enamoured
trance of technic enjoyment, we look for the character and the
sentiment embodied by such art; we find, instead of Charles, a
cold, flimsy, shuffling figure, with pretension to importance,
but without dignity,&mdash;a man absorbed by his garment.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Kermesse, ou fête de Village</span>&mdash;Kermis, or Village
Gambols."&mdash;Rubens.</p>

<p class="blockquot">This is rustic mirth personified. Rapidity of conception and
equality of execution equally surprise in this composition;
variety and unity separate and combine its numerous groups; the
canvass reels; the satiated eye might perhaps wish for a little
more subordination, for a mass more eminently distinguished by
white or black, to give a zest to the clogging sweetness of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
general form. But Rubens worked under influence, and his pencil
roamed through the whole without predilection: he was not here a
painter; he was the instrument of untameable mirth. There is a
group in this picture which seems to have been suggested by the
struggling group of two soldiers in the cartoon of the horsemen,
by Leonardo da Vinci. This may be judged a cold observation; but
artists must judge coldly.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Zustris.&mdash;"Venus on her bed waiting for Mars, playing with Cupid
and her Doves."</p>

<p class="blockquot">This wanton conceit is a singular phænomenon on the Dutch
horizon of art. We know no more of Zustris than what the
catalogue chooses to inform us; but his work proves, that if he
could conceive amorously, or what might be better styled,
libidinously, he grew cold in the progress of execution. The
face of Venus does not assist her action. The picture wants
shade, and glow, and keeping; but there is an idea of elegance
in the lines, and the flesh wants only shade to become Venetian.</p>


<h4><br />TITIAN&mdash;PORTRAIT OF TITIAN AND HIS MISTRESS.</h4>

<p class="blockquot">The full value of this picture cannot perhaps be appreciated
better than when it is considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span> after the examination of a
portrait by Rubens. The unaffected breadth, the modest,
unambitious reflexes, an air of suffusion rather than penciling,
a certain resignation even in the touch, shew us Nature, rather
than its image. This charming female displays a mind superior to
the cares of the toilet she is engaged with, sees beyond the
mirror which her lover holds, and at which her lover, if it be
her lover, assists. The great merit of Titian, and perhaps his
exclusive merit as to execution, is to be totally free from all
pretence, from all affectation. His vehicle conveys the idea of
the thing, and passes unobserved. To Tintoret, to Paolo&mdash;the
thing in general served to convey the vehicle. The Miracle of
St. Marc derives all its merit from that whirlpool of execution,
which sweeps undistinguished all individual merit into one
mighty mass. As a whole, of equal comprehension, energy, and
suavity, it astonishes the common man of organs, and the artist
who enters into the process of this amalgama, equally; but when
the first charm is over, and we begin to examine the parts, we
shall not find they were drawn forward, distanced, or excluded
by propriety and character." </p>

<p><br />The intimacy which commenced in Paris, in the year 1801, between Fuseli
and Mr. Robert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span> Smirke, the celebrated architect, was kept up; and when
he left England for Italy, the former gave him letters of introduction
for Rome, which he found very useful. This kindness on the part of
Fuseli, was acknowledged by Mr. R. Smirke in the following letter:</p>

<p class="inright"><br />"Rome, March 20, 1803.</p>

<p class="blockquot"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">"<span class="smcap">dear sir</span>,</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">"<span class="smcap">I have</span>, you see, a second time availed myself of your
permission to write to you; but as it is now above two months
since I sent my last letter, you will not find the intrusion, I
hope, troublesome. There is, I always feel, a sort of pleasure
in communications of this kind with a distant friend, which is
extremely agreeable; when writing, at the moment, I forget the
distance of 1500 miles, and am talking with him. You desired I
would endeavour to write to you in Italian; I must confess,
however, that as yet I feel such a deficiency in my knowledge of
that language as to make me afraid of venturing upon so bold a
task; and as I have been so neglectful as not to attend
regularly to instructions in it, I am afraid it will be yet some
time before I can venture. In justification, nevertheless, I
have to say that I never avoid the opportunity of being obliged
to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span> use of it; and in the house I live, no language but
Italian is spoken.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"It was a considerable time after my arrival in Rome that I
succeeded in finding Signor Ven. Gambini, though doubtless only
from want of more proper application. I found that his memory of
you and your friendship with him had not failed in the slightest
degree; he enquired with much kindness after you, and showed me
immediately a book, in which he has preserved with care a sketch
you made upon one of the leaves; the only memorial, he told me,
that he had of your work. He has a bust of you, which he has
placed in his principal room, between those of Clio and
Melpomene; it gave me really much pleasure to see the
remembrance of a friend, absent between twenty and thirty years,
so warmly preserved. His reception of me was, as you may
suppose, extremely kind and civil; but as I find him surrounded
with books, probably in a busy employment, and that so different
to mine, I have not seen much of him, nor cannot but be afraid
always of being troublesome.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"It is now nearly two months since I arrived in Rome, having
scarcely stopt on the road after leaving Pisa, whence my last
letter to you was dated, except for two or three days at
Sienna.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span> Florence pleased me very much, from the slight view I
had of it. I was there but a day, as I purpose spending a month
there, at least, on my return from the southern parts of the
country. The Gallery, I suppose, must be much less interesting
since the French have taken so much from it; but as it is, it
struck me particularly. I was much pleased with the arrangement;
for though it has nothing of the astonishing <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d'&oelig;il</i> of
the Louvre, I should think it was better calculated to shew the
statues and pictures, and still more, to assist the artist who
studies from them.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"I have been very highly gratified with what I have seen in
Rome. The numerous remains of excellent Roman art, both in
sculpture and architecture; the magnificent appearance of many
of the modern buildings; the splendour of the churches, and many
collections of paintings, cannot fail to make it always a most
interesting place even to those who at other times have felt but
slightly the excellencies of art. It has, I imagine, suffered a
good deal during the last eight years. What the French have
taken, (though perhaps the finest works,) is not the only loss,
for the distress and poverty attending the confusions of the
country have caused the sale of the best pictures in many of the
collections, and a sad neglect in general of their palaces.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span> St.
Peter's did not quite equal my expectations. I never anticipated
<i>much</i> from the architecture; but it was in the general
appearance to the eye that I was in some degree disappointed.
The grandeur of the approach (the circular portico, fountains,
and vestibule) is certainly most striking; but in the interior
particularly, there appears to me a great want of proportion,
and from the colossal boys and decorations crowding about it,
the just scale much destroyed; neither do I think the richness
of the finishings, or the strong glare of light admitted into
the building, quite appropriate to the solemnity of its
character. In the Vatican adjoining, I believe but little
alteration has taken place since you were here, except in the
rooms containing the statues. They are chiefly small, but have
been fitted up with much elegance. The wonderful picture of
Michael Angelo in the Capella Sistina is quite uninjured. Those
in the ceiling will not, I am afraid, (as they ought,) resist
for ever the injuries of weather. One small piece affected by
damp on the outside has fallen. What a pity it is they did not
observe the precaution made use of by the ancients, by which
many of their fresco works remain as perfect as when first
painted!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span> A space of two or three inches was left between the
wall and tile on which the stucco was laid, so that it was
completely defended from all exterior damps. I was disappointed
in the Arabesque paintings of Raphael in the Galleries; of
course not in the design, but in the present condition; they are
so injured by being exposed to the open air, as to be much
obliterated. His fresco paintings in the same palace are in good
preservation. Of Michael Angelo and Raphael, though I had seen
but very few of their works, and certainly among the least able
to appreciate their merits till I came here; I had no idea of
what painters they were, nor how they could so represent Nature
in all its actions.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"I have seen most of the modern artists of Rome&mdash;they are
chiefly young. They have many large, bold undertakings in hand;
several subjects I have seen, twenty-five feet long, either for
churches, or for the Earl of Bristol, an old nobleman here of
singular character, who gives sometimes much encouragement, and
often beyond, I believe, even his power. The manner of painting
is very like what I think I have observed among the French: much
attention and minuteness in detail, while the great principal
object of the story is perhaps failed in. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span> is not however,
I think, so much extravagance in the representation of action,
as I often observed in the modern French pictures. Among the
best historical painters here are Camuccini, Landi, and
Benvenuti. Of the sculptors, Canova, of course, holds by far the
highest rank; many of his works are certainly very beautifully
designed and executed. Next to him, one of the name of
Maximilian is placed as the best. With respect to the modern
architecture, both in its churches and palaces, I must confess
myself somewhat surprised that the excellent models of ancient
art constantly before them have not been more successfully
studied. In general, I think the taste is of rather a heavy,
disagreeable kind, but often a sort of magnificence in the whole
effect which is imposing. I purpose now leaving Rome for a time,
intending on my return to devote some time to more attentive and
diligent study. My time hitherto has been employed, for a great
part, in seeing all the different antiquities and buildings
contained within the extensive walls of the city and in its
suburbs. You may not perhaps have heard of my intention of
spending two or three months in Greece, as it is within so short
a time that I have determined upon it, and consequently since I
communicated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span> it to my family at home. I have been making many
inquiries here, and find it a journey practicable, and as little
subject to difficulties as one can expect; I think too that one
may derive more advantage from a study of the ancient works
there, which are less known, and which have perhaps been the
models of the finest here, than from any in this country. When
writing my last letter home, in which I mentioned my intention,
I thought of going by way of Ancona, where I should embark in a
vessel that went to any part of Greece; since then, I have
somewhat changed my plan, purposing now to go by way of Naples
and Otranto, and there embarking for Corfu. It may still be
nearly a fortnight before I set out, as some preparation is
necessary. Greece, it appears, does not afford the little
conveniences found in this country for travellers. I am very
well provided with letters there from the kindness of some
English I have met with here. There is one family from whom I
have received much kindness, (the Earl of Mount Cashell's,) with
whom I believe you are acquainted, as I have often heard you
spoken of in it.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"My paper leaves me no more room than to say, if you should ever
have leisure to write me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span> a few lines, they will be received
with the greatest pleasure; and wishing you the best health,</p>

"Henry Fuseli, Esq. R.A."<br />
</p>

<p class="blockquot">"My direction will be at Mr. Fagan's, Piazza Colonna, Rome." </p>

<p class="p2">In the year 1803, Fuseli left Queen-Anne-Street, and took the lease of a
commodious house, No. 13, Berners' Street, which had been built by Sir
William Chambers for his own residence; here he remained until December
1804, when he was elected Keeper of the Royal Academy, Mr. Rigaud being
then his competitor. The salary and commodious apartments allotted to
this office placed him in such circumstances as to render him, in a
degree, independent of fortuitous commissions. Although now in his
sixty-fourth year, he retained great mental and bodily activity, and
from his taste and extensive knowledge in the higher branches of the
fine arts, a more judicious choice could not have been made by the
Members of the Royal Academy; this opinion was expressed by his late
Majesty, George the Third, when the President,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span> Mr. West, laid before
him the resolution of the Academicians for his approval.</p>

<p>The following anecdote connected with his election has been told, but
not correctly. When Fuseli tendered himself for the office of Keeper of
the Royal Academy, Northcote and Opie voted against him; but being
conscience-stricken, not only on account of his abilities, but from
having received favours at his hands, they considered it right to call
upon him the day after the election to explain their motives. After
having heard them, and in their explanation they in some degree blamed
each other; he answered, in his usual sarcastic manner, "I am sorry you
have taken this trouble, because I shall lose my character in the
neighbourhood. When you entered my house, the one must have been taken
for a little Jew creditor, the other for a bum-bailiff; so, good
morning."</p>

<p>This year (1804) Fuseli visited Liverpool for the last time, and passed
a great deal of his time while there with Mr. Roscoe: on his return to
London, he wrote the following letter to Mr. Joseph Johnson, the nephew
of his much respected friend of that name:&mdash;</p>

<p class="inright"><br />"London, June 21, 1804.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">"<span class="smcap">dear sir</span>,</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">"Give me leave to return you my warmest thanks for your
kindness. Though my circumstances did not permit me to spend as
many hours as I could have wished under your hospitable roof,
every moment I passed with you and Mrs. Johnson, added some new
obligation to those which you had already heaped on me and mine,
and it will be one of my warmest wishes to be able to shew, at
some time or other, that my gratitude lies deeper than my lips.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"I have spent a day or two at Purser's Cross, which is the name
of your Uncle's place; though in the neighbourhood of London, it
is a sweet retired and healthful spot, and if he could be
persuaded to spend more of his time at it, must be eminently
conducive to his health. I hope Mrs. Johnson has not forgot her
promise, to come and reside and nurse him there, as soon as it
is in her power.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">In</span> June 1825, Mr. Bonnycastle, late Professor of Mathematics to the
Royal Military College at Woolwich, who had then been the intimate
friend of Fuseli for twenty-five years, introduced me to him, having
observed previously to this introduction, that I should find him a man
of the most extensive knowledge, quickness of perception, ready wit, and
acuteness of remark, that I had ever met with. This introduction was
soon followed by daily intercourse between Fuseli and myself, which
ripened into the sincerest friendship, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span> the cause of my passing
with him many of the happiest hours of my life.</p>

<p>In the year 1805, some of the booksellers wishing to publish an improved
edition of Pilkington's Dictionary of Painters, applied to Fuseli,
through Mr. Johnson, to be the editor. In consequence of the
solicitation of this friend, he accepted the task, but with reluctance,
as he had a mean opinion of the work, and constantly designated its
author a driveller. To the original he added a great number of names,
and either re-wrote the lives, or inserted in notes the characters of
most of the principal painters of the several schools.</p>

<p>At this period, a number of noblemen and gentlemen, zealous for the
encouragement of the fine arts in England, especially historical
painting, established the British Institution, and Fuseli was solicited
to send thither some pictures for exhibition and sale. He, however, had
no high opinion of the scheme; for although, in common with other
artists, he wished it to succeed&mdash;for he held that "the man who
purchases one picture from a living artist, which may have some
pretensions to the highest class of art, does more real service to the
fine arts than he who spends thousands upon the works of the old
masters;" yet he thought, to use his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span> own words, "from the colour of the
egg, it was more likely to produce an ichneumon than a sphynx;" and
expressed reluctance to be a contributor. Mr. Coutts, who used every
endeavour to promote the establishment and the prosperity of the British
Institution, advised him to become an exhibitor, and to send, among
other pictures, "The Lazar-house," observing, "I never intended to
deprive you of this, it is yours, and therefore sell it, if you can." In
addition to this picture, the price of which was fixed at 300 guineas,
Fuseli sent "The Nursery of Shakspeare," for which he asked 150 guineas;
and "Christ disappearing at Emaus:" the price he put upon this was 100
guineas. The leading members of the Institution hesitated to admit that
admirable production of his pencil, "The Lazar-house," considering the
subject too terrible for the public eye; and they had three meetings
before they came to the resolution of exhibiting it. This hesitation on
their part, a slight degree of damage which "The Nursery of Shakspeare"
sustained in its removal from the rooms, and the not finding a purchaser
for either of the pictures, made Fuseli resolve never to exhibit there
again, to which resolution he pertinaciously adhered.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> </p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1806, he painted from Dante, Count Ugolino being starved to death
with his four sons in the Tower, which, from that circumstance, was
afterwards called, "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Torre della Fame</span>;" this picture, as it came in
competition with that well known subject from the pencil of Sir Joshua
Reynolds, was admired and censured more than any other he had previously
produced. Fuseli took the moment when Ugolino is petrified by his
situation,&mdash;"bereft of tears, his heart is turned to stone;" he has
represented him in a sitting posture with his youngest son stretched
dead over his knees, while the other three are either writhing under the
agonies of hunger, dying, or given up to despair. This picture (now in
my possession) is as superior in drawing, in truth to nature placed
under such circumstances, and to the story, as Sir Joshua's soars above
it in colour, in manual dexterity, and in <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">chiaroscuro</span>.</p>

<p>Mr. Blake, who was not only a celebrated engraver, but known also for
his original designs, distributed this year (1805) a prospectus for
publishing an edition of the poem of "The Grave" of William Blair, to be
illustrated with fifteen plates designed and engraved by himself. This
work was patronized by the names of the principal artists of the day;
but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span> before he entered upon its publication, he submitted his drawings
to the judgment of the then President of the Royal Academy (Mr. West),
and also to Fuseli. The latter, in particular, being pleased with the
wildness of the invention, wrote his opinion thereon in the following
words:</p>

<p class="blockquot"><br />"The moral series here submitted to the public, from its object and
method of execution, has a double claim on general attention.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"In an age of equal refinement and corruption of manners, when systems
of education and seduction go hand in hand; when Religion itself
compounds with fashion; when, in the pursuit of present enjoyment, all
consideration of futurity vanishes, and the real object of life is
lost&mdash;in such an age, every exertion confers a benefit on society which
tends to impress Man with his destiny, to hold the mirror up to life,
less indeed to discriminate its characters, than those situations which
shew what all are born for, what all ought to act for, and what all must
inevitably come to.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The importance of this object has been so well understood at every
period of time, from the earliest and most innocent to the latest and
most depraved, that reason and fancy have exhausted their stores of
argument and imagery, to impress it on the mind: animate <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>and inanimate
Nature, the seasons, the forest and the field, the bee and ant, the
larva, chrysalis and moth, have lent their real or supposed analogies
with the origin, pursuits, and end, of the human race, so often to
emblematical purposes, that instruction is become stale, and attention
callous. The Serpent with its tail in its mouth, from a type of
Eternity, is become an infant's bauble; even the nobler idea of Hercules
pausing between virtue and vice, and the varied imagery of Death leading
his patients to the Grave, owe their effect upon us more to technic
excellence than allegoric utility.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Aware of this, but conscious that affectation of originality and trite
repetition would equally impede his success, the Author of the moral
series before us has endeavoured to wake sensibility by touching our
sympathies with nearer, less ambiguous, and less ludicrous imagery, than
what mythology, Gothic superstition, or symbols as far-fetched as
inadequate could supply. His invention has been chiefly employed to
spread a familiar and domestic atmosphere round the most important of
all subjects, to connect the visible and the invisible World, without
provoking probability, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span> lead the eye from the milder light of
time to the radiations of Eternity.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Such is the plan and the moral part of the Author's invention; the
technic part, and the execution of the artist, though to be examined by
other principles, and addressed to a narrower circle, equally claim
approbation, sometimes excite our wonder, and not seldom our fears, when
we see him play on the very verge of legitimate invention; but wildness
so picturesque in itself, so often redeemed by taste, simplicity, and
elegance, what child of fancy, what artist would wish to discharge? The
groups and single figures on their own bases, abstracted from the
general composition, and considered without attention to the plan,
frequently exhibit those genuine and unaffected attitudes, those simple
graces which Nature and the heart alone can dictate, and only an eye
inspired by both, discover. Every class of artists, in every stage of
their progress or attainments, from the student to the finished master,
and from the contriver of ornament to the painter of history, will find
here materials of art and hints of improvement!"</p>

<p class="p2">This opinion he allowed Blake to publish as recommendatory of his work.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>In the early part of the year 1806, the Council of the Royal Academy
requested that Fuseli would again deliver a course of lectures on
painting, which he accordingly did, as Mr. Opie had not prepared his.
This course he prefaced by the following address:</p>

<p class="blockquot"><br /><span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Gentlemen,</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">"I once more have the unexpected honour of addressing you in
this place, at the request of the President and Council, with
the concurrence, and at the express desire of the Gentleman whom
the Academy has appointed my successor, and whose superior
ability, whenever he shall think proper to lay his materials
before you, will, I trust, make ample amends for the defects
which your indulgence has, for several years, connived at in my
recital of these fragments on our art." </p>

<p class="p2">Fuseli had now been more than two years Keeper of the Academy, which had
afforded the students sufficient time to appreciate the value of his
instructions, particularly in the antique school. And in order to mark
their sense of the advantages which they had derived from his talents,
they presented him, by the hands of Mr. Haydon, then a student, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span> an
elegant silver Vase, the design for which, at their solicitation, was
given by that eminent artist Flaxman; it bears the following
inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><br /><b>TO<br />
HENRY FUSELI, ESQ. R.A.<br />
KEEPER OF THE ROYAL ACADEMY,<br />
FROM<br />
THE STUDENTS.<br />
1807.</b>
</p>

<p><br />The Vase, by the desire of Fuseli and the kindness of his widow, is now
in my possession; and I not only value it as a beautiful work of art,
but regard it as a tribute paid to the genius and talents of my honoured
friend, whose memory will ever be held most dear in my recollection.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1809, Fuseli wished me to accompany him into the
country for a short time; but as I had promised to pass three or four
weeks with a relation and friend (who was much esteemed by him), the
Reverend Thomas Rackett, at Spettisbury, in Dorsetshire, I could not
accede to his solicitations. The following letter written to me while
there, as it shews the disposition of his mind, and gives some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span> account
of his pursuits, may not be uninteresting in this place.</p>

<p class="inright"><br />"Somerset House, 31st August, 1809.</p>

<p class="blockquot"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">"<span class="smcap">dear sir</span>,</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">"<span class="smcap">Your</span> letter of the 26th, which I found on my desk at my return
from Fulham, gave me equal surprise and pleasure; nothing but
yourself could have been more welcome, and I should not have
waited till now, to present you in answer with a scrawl of mine,
had I not been desirous of obliging Mr. Cavallo by adding a
specimen of Lavater's hand-writing: several old parcels of
letters did I turn over, but that which contains the chirognomic
characters of my departed friend, I have not yet been able to
light on, and am afraid it is in some bundle of papers at
Purser's Cross, to which place I shall probably return on
Saturday, and on finding what I want, take care to remit it to
you for Don Tiberio.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

mind like yours, fraught with all the requisites for genuine
pleasure, is sure to find it or to make it in every place; how
much must you enjoy then in the friendly mansion which separates
you from me and those real friends you have left here!</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Your account of the Nunneries you have visited, confirms
Hamlets verdict: 'Frailty, thy name is woman!' How
self-contradictory, that the 'animal of beauty,' as Dante calls
woman, should exchange her claims to social admiration and
pleasure, and the substantial charms of life, for the sterile
embraces of a crucifix or some withered sister, by the dim
glimmer of cloistered light,&mdash;lost to hope, and marked by
oblivion for her own! Tyranny, deception, and most of all, that
substitute for every other want, 'the undistinguished space of
woman's will,' can alone account for such phenomena.</p>

unpropitious, I do not expect to hear of many entomological
captures or discoveries: I beg to inform him, that of some pupæ
of <i>Sphinx euphorbiæ</i>, found on the spurge of the Devonshire
sands, I have reared, perhaps for the first time in England, two
beautiful moths.</p>

<p class="insmall">"To John Knowles, Esq."</p>


<p class="p2">I have already noticed the social intimacy which subsisted for so long a
time between Fuseli and Mr. Johnson the bookseller; the latter had been
afflicted with an asthma for many years. In the month of December, 1809,
he had an alarming attack of this disorder, which increasing rapidly, a
message was sent to Fuseli, intimating that if he wished again to see
Mr. Johnson, he must come without delay. A carriage was instantly
ordered, and as it drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span> up, Mr. Carrick Moore the Surgeon, of whose
abilities, Fuseli had the highest opinion, accidently arrived at the
Academy. Fuseli, who was in tears and in violent agitation, cried out,
"Come with me, I beseech you, Moore, and save, if possible, my valued
friend, Johnson." On their arrival at Mr. Johnson's house, in St. Paul's
Church-yard, they found him breathing with difficulty, his countenance
ghastly, his limbs cold, and his quivering pulse hardly perceptible; he,
however, recognised Fuseli, and expressed pleasure at seeing him. But no
means which were tried could restore the sinking energies of the vital
functions, and the patient in a short time ceased to live.</p>

<p>As Fuseli had been on terms of intimacy and of the strictest friendship
with Johnson for nearly forty years, this sad event shocked his
sensitive heart. He wrote the day after to Mr. Joseph Johnson, the
nephew, in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<p class="inright"><br />"London, Somerset House, 21st Dec. 1829.</p>

<p class="blockquot"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">"<span class="smcap">my dear sir</span>,</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">"<span class="smcap">As</span> the present melancholy occasion must bring you, and perhaps
Mrs. Johnson, to London, permit me to request the favour of
your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span> remaining with us, and taking a bed at our house during
your stay.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"If my grief for the loss of my first and best friend were less
excessive, I might endeavour to moderate your's; but I want
consolation too much myself to offer it to others.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"My wife joins in my request to you and Mrs. Johnson, and we
both remain ever your faithful but disconsolate friends,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">"<span class="smcap">Sophia and Henry Fuseli</span>."</span><br />
</p>
<p class="insmall">"Joseph Johnson, Esq."<br />
</p>


<p class="p2">Mr. Johnson was regretted not only by a numerous circle of private
friends, but by the literary world in general. Many authors now living,
and others who have paid the debt of nature, were fostered by his
bounty, and but for his encouragement the world would have been deprived
of most of the beautiful poems of Cowper; for, when "The Task," not
being appreciated by the public, met with a very tardy sale, its author
had made up his mind to write no more. Mr. Johnson, who was well aware
of the merits of this poem, urged him to proceed, stating, that he had
no doubt it would finally receive that favour from the public which it
so justly merited. This expectation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span> was afterwards realized to its
utmost extent, and the author received from his publisher a handsome but
unexpected gratuity.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Johnson was a man of probity, liberality, and sound sense, with an
acute judgment. The author of this memoir, who witnessed the urbanity of
his manners, and partook of the hospitality of his table at least once
a-week for some years, can bear testimony to these, as well as to the
good sense which he exercised, and the prudence with which he allayed
the occasional contests of his irritable guests, many of whom were
distinguished men of letters, of various characters, and conflicting
opinions. And although the conversation took a free range, yet the
placid equanimity of their host regulated in some degree its freedom,
and kept it within due bounds. Fuseli was always a favoured guest at
this table; when absent, which rarely happened, a gloom for the time
pervaded the company: but, when present, his acute taste in poetry,
oratory, and the fine arts; his original opinions, singular ideas, and
poignant wit, enlivened the conversation, and rendered him a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span> delightful
companion. On these occasions, however, Johnson was rather a listener
than a contributor; but he enjoyed the animated remarks and retorts of
his amusing friend, and in his will left him a handsome legacy.</p>

<p>Fuseli wrote the following epitaph, which gives a just and unvarnished
character of this amiable man, and which is placed on his tomb in the
church-yard of Fulham:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><br /><b>HERE LIE THE REMAINS OF<br /><br />

</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>The death of Opie, which took place rather unexpectedly, in 1807, after
he had delivered only four lectures at the Royal Academy, in which he
availed himself of several remarks of Fuseli in his unpublished
discourses, caused a vacancy in the Professorship, which was filled by
the election of Mr. Tresham. This appointment he held until the early
part of the year 1810, and then tendered his resignation, declining to
lecture under the plea of indisposition. The Academicians met for the
purpose of electing a Professor of Painting; but no one offering
himself, all being aware of the great talents of Fuseli in this
particular, they came to a resolution, that a law which forbids the same
person to hold two situations, should be dormant in his case; he was
therefore re-elected Professor of Painting on the 10th of February,
1810, and was allowed to retain the joint offices of Keeper of the
Academy and Professor of Painting during the remainder of his life. A
higher compliment than this could not have been paid to any man, and it
marked in an extraordinary manner the estimation in which his talents
were held.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">On</span> the 26th of February 1810, Fuseli resumed his course of lectures, and
prefaced them by the following address:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot"><br /><span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Mr. President, and Gentlemen,</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">"Sincere as my gratitude and pleasing as my emotions must be on
being, by the indulgence of the Academy, appointed to address
you again, I should feel myself unworthy of this honour were I
not to regret the infirm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span> state of health, the unfortunate cause
which occasioned the resignation of the Professor of Painting,
and disappointed the expectation you had a right to form from
the display of his brilliant talents. Severely, however, as this
disappointment may be felt by you, it is a consolation to
reflect that we still possess him, and that the Academy may
still profit by his advice and practical abilities: but what can
I offer to mitigate our grief on the awful decree which snatched
from us his predecessor, your late lecturer, my departed friend?
In him society has lost one of its best members, our Art one of
its firmest supporters, the Academy one of its brightest
ornaments, and you a solid, experienced, forcible, and lucid
instructor. The innate vigour of his mind supplied every want of
education; his persevering energy ruled circumstances, and made
necessity the handmaid of the art; his judgment, at a very early
period, discriminated the art itself from those vehicles of
which he possessed, in a very high degree, the most splendid;
add to these, that insatiable curiosity, which not only
stimulated him to examine every system, and to collect every
observation on art, but to court all relative knowledge, and
whatever, though more distant, might tend to illustrate his
argument,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span> enforce his proofs, or assist his researches; and you
have an aggregate of qualities, which, if he had been suffered
to complete his course, would have enabled him to present you
with a more connected series of instructions for your studies
than perhaps ever fell to the lot of any other school, and might
have conferred on England the honour of having produced the best
combined, least prejudiced, if not the most lofty or extensive
system of art.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Such was your teacher:&mdash;to expatiate on the artist before his
companions, admirers, rivals, and scholars, within these walls,
which have so often borne testimony to the splendour and
versatility of his powers, would be equally presumption and
waste of time: that characteristic truth, that unaffected
simplicity and air of life which discriminate his portraits; the
decision, the passion, the colour, the effects that animate his
history; the solidity of his method, his breadth and mellowness
of touch, now fresh before us, with his writings, will survive
and consecrate to memory the name of <span class="smcap">Opie</span>." </p>

<p class="p2">Fuseli, this year (1810), gave a second edition of his "Pilkington's
Dictionary of the Painters;" to this he added more than three hundred
names and characters of artists, chiefly of the Spanish school, enlarged
the notes given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span> in the previous edition, corrected some mistakes in
dates, and gave in an appendix a few names which had been omitted in the
alphabetical order, and also many particulars of the great masters of
the Italian school; the last he considered as too prolix for the body of
the work.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1813, Fuseli was attacked with a considerable degree of
fever on the nerves, attended with great depression of spirits: this he
considered a similar disease, but much milder in its effects than that
with which he had been afflicted in 1772, at Rome. This indisposition he
felt the more, from having enjoyed for the last forty-three years, an
uninterrupted state of good health. His medical friends advised change
of air, and more particularly for that of the sea-side. He accordingly
determined to pass a month at Hastings, and prevailed upon the writer of
this memoir to accompany him thither. The frequenters of this salubrious
bathing-place, called by some the <i>Montpelier</i> of England, will hardly
recognise, from its present improved state, the description given of it
by Fuseli in a letter to a friend; but it was a true picture of the town
at that time. "Hastings appears to me to have been constructed by a
conspiracy of bone-setters, surgeons, and dissectors, as the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
commodious theatre of all possible accidents in contusions, falls,
dislocations, sprains, and fractures. The houses of one side of the
High-street, <i>i.e.</i> the most inhabited part of the town, are built on
what they misname a terrace; but, in fact, it is a mass of stony
fragments gathered from the shore, without any other polish than what
the wave had left behind; raised four or five feet above the road,
unguarded on the edge, and consequently, without the perpetual
interference of miracles, fatal to every stranger who approaches them at
night, in winter thaws, when spangled with ice, or flooded from the
tremendous ridge that beetles o'er the house-tops."</p>

<p>To form an adequate and correct opinion of the extent of Fuseli's
talents and information, and a proper notion of his feelings, it was
necessary to be an inmate of the same house: from the experience of this
and a subsequent opportunity, I can, with truth, assert, that he was not
only a most intellectual, but a pleasant and accommodating companion.
After a month had been spent at this pleasant watering-place, I had the
satisfaction of returning to London with him, he being restored to
perfect health.</p>

<p>This year (1813) he painted a picture for Mr. Joseph Johnson, of
Liverpool, "Marcus Curius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span> preparing his frugal repast." When Mr.
Johnson gave the commission, he said, "I wish the subject to be some
mentally heroic action, taken either from the English or Roman History."
When this picture was finished, Fuseli addressed the following letter to
his friend:&mdash;</p>

<p class="inright"><br />"London, Oct. 8, 1813.</p>

<p class="blockquot"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">"<span class="smcap">dear sir</span>,</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">"<span class="smcap">I have</span> not been unmindful of what you so kindly commissioned me
to undertake for you, and the picture which I have painted now
only waits your commands. The <i>subject</i>, though not English, is
congenial with your own mind, and selected from the most
virtuous period of Rome. If I remember rightly, you approved of
it when we discussed the subjects here; but as you may not
perhaps have since had leisure to reconsider it, you will permit
me to repeat it as concisely to you as I can, and nearly in the
words of Valerius Maximus. 'Marcus Curius, who had repeatedly
smitten the Samnites, seated in his rustic chair, preparing his
simple meal in a wooden bowl, exhibited to the admiring Legates
of the Samnites at once, with the proof of the most rigid
frugality, his own superiority. Commissioned by the state, they
spread before him treasure, and humbly solicited his
acceptance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span> With a smile of disdain, scarcely deigning to look
at it, Curius replied&mdash;Take back these baubles to those who sent
you, and tell them that Marcus Curius prefers subduing the rich
to being rich himself, and that you found him as impregnable by
bribes as irresistible in arms.'</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Such is the subject, my dear Sir, which I have endeavoured to
compose and execute for you, as well as my capacity and practice
permitted; I wish they had been greater. I remain, with my
wife's and my own warmest wishes for your own, dear Mrs.
Johnson's, and son's health and happiness, dear Sir,</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 10em;">

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">"<span class="smcap">Henry Fuseli</span>."</span>
</p>
<p class="insmall">"Joseph Johnson, Esq."<br />
</p>


<p class="p2">Fuseli kept up a constant intercourse with his friends at Liverpool, and
particularly with Mr. Roscoe. The correspondence which passed between
this gentleman and him sometimes had relation to literature, but more
frequently to the fine arts; the following is a specimen of the
latter:&mdash;</p>

<p class="inright"><br />"Liverpool, 24th May, 1814.</p>

<p class="blockquot"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">"<span class="smcap">my dear friend</span>,</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">"<span class="smcap">When</span> my son Robert left us, about ten days since, I sent by him
a slight outline of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span> frieze, under a picture of a Holy Family,
by Ghirlandajo, desiring him to give it you, and to enquire
whether you agree with me in thinking it likely to be the
production of Michelagnolo, who is said to have painted in the
pictures of Ghirlandajo, whilst a student with him. Slight as it
is, being, in fact, only the copy of a copy, you will be able to
form an opinion of it at first sight. The picture is in
distemper as well as the frieze, which is executed in <span
lang="it" xml:lang="it">chiar' oscuro</span>, in a sort of oblong
broken touches, producing on the whole a good effect. The
superiority of the style of the frieze to that of the picture is
evident, and demonstrates to a certainty that they are the work
of different hands.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"I think I also told you, some time since, that I had a picture
of Leo X., with the Cardinals de' Medici and Rossi, which I have
reason to believe is the copy made by Andrea del Sarto, from
that of Raffaelle, and which was first sent to Mantua,
afterwards went to Parma, and thence to Capo di Monte, where it
is now no longer to be found. Many persons who had seen it
there, assure me this is undoubtedly the same picture. I have
had it some years, and having been frequently asked whether I
had taken it out of the frame to look for the mark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span> mentioned by
Vasari, I determined, a few months since, to examine it, and
sending for two or three friends, we took it out, and on the
<i>edge of the pannel</i>, near the shoulder of the Cardinal de'
Medici, found the remains of an inscription, in large letters,
which I conjecture to mean, "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Andrea Florentinus Pinxit</i>," with
the date, which is so far obliterated as to be wholly illegible.
At all events, there undoubtedly has been an inscription on the
edge of the pannel, a circumstance in itself highly favourable
to its being the very picture which Vasari has described. This
picture is most highly finished, has an indescribable force of
colouring, and is in as fine a state of preservation as the day
it was painted. Those who have seen the picture of Raffaelle in
the Louvre, assure me that this is in every respect equal to it.
I long to have your decision on these two pictures, but hope it
will be on the spot.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"I lately got a fine picture by Bernardino Lovini, which
confirms in every point the account which Lanzi and you have
given of him. It is a Holy Family, with two attendant pilgrims,
saints, small life. I think you will admire it for its
simplicity, pathos, and beautiful colouring.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"I have a friend in Liverpool, who is a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span> chymist, and
prepares colours, which I believe to be of a superior quality.
His name is Strahan, and his agent for the sale of them in
London, is <i>Mr. Thos. Clay, No. 18, Ludgate-hill</i>. I shall
esteem it a favour if you will make a trial of them, and if they
should be found to answer better than those you are already
supplied with, would recommend them to your friends. I believe
they are already in some degree known amongst the artists; but
Mr. Strahan is very desirous that you should make a trial of
them; and I have promised him <i>all my interest with you</i> for the

<p class="p2">Canova visited England in the summer of 1816, and was then very much
struck with the pictures, as well as pleased with Fuseli's society. This
eminent sculptor remarked, that he not only showed the brilliancy of
genius in his conversation, but that he spoke Italian with the purity of
a well-educated native of Rome.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span> And on his return, the Academy of St.
Luke, at Rome, at his request, sent a diploma, constituting Fuseli a
member of the first class, an honour which was conferred also, by the
like recommendation, upon Sir Thomas Lawrence and Mr. Flaxman.</p>

<p>In the year 1817, Fuseli sat, at my request, to Harlow for his portrait,
which is on pannel, of a cabinet size. This eminent painter was highly
gratified by the compliment, and exerted every faculty to do his best.
Fuseli obliged him and me by giving for this picture twelve sittings of
two hours each; and a more perfect resemblance, or characteristic
portrait, has seldom been painted. I attended Fuseli at each sitting,
and during the progress of this portrait. Harlow commenced and finished
his best and most esteemed work, "The trial of Queen Katherine," in
which he has introduced many portraits; but more particularly those of
the Kemble family; in the performance of this work, he owed many
obligations to Fuseli for his critical remarks; for when he first saw
the picture (chiefly in dead colouring), he said, "I do not disapprove
of the general arrangement of your work, and I see you will give it a
powerful effect of light and shadow; but you have here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span> a composition of
more than twenty figures, or I should rather say parts of figures;
because you have not shewn one leg or foot, which makes it very
defective. Now, if you do not know how to draw legs and feet, I will
shew you;" and taking up a crayon, drew two on the wainscot of the room.
Harlow profited by these remarks, and the next time we saw the picture,
the whole arrangement in the foreground was changed. Fuseli then said,
"So far you have done well; but now you have not introduced a back
figure, to throw the eye of the spectator into the picture;" and then
pointed out by what means he might improve it in this particular.
Accordingly Harlow introduced the two boys who are taking up the
cushion; that which shews the back, is altogether due to Fuseli, and is
certainly the best drawn figure in the picture. Fuseli afterwards
attempted to get him to improve the drawing of the arms of the principal
object (Mrs. Siddons), who is represented as Queen Katherine, but
without much effect, particularly the left; and after having witnessed
many ineffectual attempts of the painter to accomplish this, he
desisted, and remarked, "It is pity that you never attended the Antique
Academy."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>Harlow proved himself, on many occasions, to be among the vainest of
men, and generally wished it to be believed that he possessed
information to which he was a stranger. On one occasion he said to me,
"It is extraordinary that Fuseli, who is so fine a scholar, should
suffer engravers to place translations under the plates taken from the
classical subjects painted by him;" and remarked, "I was educated a
scholar, having been at Westminster school, and therefore wish to see
the subjects given in the original languages," and then imprudently
instanced the print taken from his picture of the death of &OElig;dipus.
When Fuseli appointed the next sitting, on our way to Harlow's house, I
mentioned this conversation to him, and added, I really think he does
not understand one word of Greek or Latin, to which he gave his assent,
and remarked, "He has made, I think, an unfortunate choice; for, if I
recollect rightly, the Greek passage, as well as my translation of it,
are scratched in under the mezzotinto. But before we part, I will bring
his knowledge to the test." After he had sat the usual time, he asked
for a piece of chalk, and wrote in large letters, on the wainscot, the
following passage:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>After having done so, he said to Harlow, "Read that," and finding by his
hesitation that he did not understand a letter, he resumed, "On our way
hither, Knowles told me you had said that I ought not to permit
engravers to put translations under the prints taken from me, and that
you had instanced the &OElig;dipus; now that is the Greek quotation whence
the subject is taken, and I find you cannot read a letter of it. Let me
give you this advice: you are undoubtedly a good portrait painter, and I
think in small pictures, such as you are painting of me, stand
unrivalled; this is sufficient merit; do not then pretend to be that
which you are not, and probably from your avocations never can be&mdash;a
scholar."</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Harlow, he was very unpopular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span> with the Royal
Academicians, and when he offered himself as a candidate for an
Associate of the Academy, there was but one vote in his favour. On the
evening of the election, Fuseli was taxed by some of his friends with
having given it, and he answered, "It is true, I did,&mdash;I voted for the
talent, and not for the man." This was not a solitary instance in which
Fuseli exercised his judgment as to the fitness of men to fill offices
in the Academy; and accordingly voted for them, distinct from any
private consideration. On a vacancy happening for the Professorship of
Anatomy, Mr. Charles Bell was among the candidates: this gentleman was
unknown to Fuseli, except by his works: his vote was requested by one of
his best and most intimate of friends (Mr. Coutts) for another person:
"I cannot," said he, "oblige you; I know of no man in England who is a
better demonstrator than Bell; and for a surgeon, he is a good artist;
such a man therefore the Academy wants for their Professor, and, as
such, I <i>must</i> vote for him."</p>

<p>The month of September 1817, I passed with my relation and friend,
Richard Wilson, Esq. of the Cliff-house, at Scarborough; on this
occasion, as was always the case when out of London, Fuseli corresponded
with me; two of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span> his letters are preserved, and I cannot refrain from
giving them to the public, as they shew the kindness of his disposition,
and the terms of friendship which subsisted between us. Understanding
that my apartments were about to be repainted, he wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot"><br />"To any other person an apology might be necessary; to you,
whose friendship can neither be heated or cooled by
correspondence or silence, I despise offering any: if by
remaining mute, I have deprived myself of one source of

letter made <i>me</i> happy, because you could not have written it,
had you not been so <i>yourself</i>.</p>

Putney-hill. Whether I shall continue so to do the remainder of

and not to persist in the foolhardy resolution of sleeping in a

<p class="insmall">"John Knowles, Esq."</p>

<p class="p2">The month of September 1818, was passed by me with Fuseli and Mrs.
Fuseli at Ramsgate; he was then in excellent health and spirits, and
although in his seventy-eighth year, had considerable bodily strength
and activity. Our constant practice was, to leave the house about five
o'clock in the morning, and sometimes earlier, to walk until eight,
breakfast, and employ ourselves during the middle of the day in reading
or writing. We walked for an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span> hour before dinner, and did the same in
the evening before we retired to rest, the usual hour for which was
about ten o'clock. It was at this place that I collated his aphorisms in
their present form, under his inspection, and then made a fair copy of
them for the press.</p>

<p>In the year 1820, he published a quarto volume, containing three
additional lectures, reprinted the three which appeared in the year
1801, with some alterations and additions, and wrote an introduction,
which he called "A Characteristic Sketch of the Principal Technic
Instruction, Ancient and Modern, which we possess." This work was
purchased by Mr. Cadell the bookseller, for three hundred pounds.</p>

<p>Mr. Bonnycastle, the Professor of Mathematics to the Royal Military
College at Woolwich, died this year (1821), in the seventieth year of
his age;<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> he had been for more than forty years the intimate friend,
occasional companion, and always a great admirer of the talents of
Fuseli. Bonnycastle was a mathematician of celebrity, independently of
which he had a fine taste for poetry and English literature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span> in general;
his memory was retentive, his knowledge extensive, and he was ever ready
to communicate what he knew. His conversational talents were of the
first order, and he occasionally enlivened his remarks with apposite
anecdotes. As he was the friend of my youth, I feel much satisfaction in
recording here my gratitude for instruction and many acts of kindness
received from this amiable man.</p>

<p>The following anecdote will afford a proof of the delicacy and feeling
of Bonnycastle's mind, and also of his excellent disposition. When his
"Introduction to Astronomy" was published, it was reviewed with a
considerable degree of asperity in a popular work of the day. Several of
his scientific friends, and Reuben Burrow in particular, considered that
it had not been fairly dealt with by the reviewer, and they determined
to discover the writer: they at length found out that it was Mr. Wales,
Mathematical Master of the School of Christ's Church Hospital. Burrow,
who was a man of quick sensibility, and an excellent mathematician, was
determined to avenge the cause of his friend, and constantly expressed
anxiety for the appearance of some new book by Wales; at length one was
published, upon "The Method of Finding the Longitude at Sea by
Chronometers."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span> Burrow procured a copy of this work, had it interleaved,
and wrote numerous remarks on, and confutations of many parts of it,
which he carried to Bonnycastle, and said, "As you have a more polished
pen than myself, use these observations of mine, and make up a sharp
review of this paltry book for the public." Bonnycastle lost no time in
doing this, and was on his road to London, with the review in his pocket
for publication, when he accidentally met Wales, who was then in so bad
a state of health that he appeared to be in the last stage of a
consumption. This affected the mind of Bonnycastle so strongly that, on
his arrival in London, he immediately burnt the manuscript review, being
determined not to hurt the feelings of a man labouring under disease,
and thus perhaps to accelerate his death.</p>

<p>In the year 1822, Fuseli was bereft of another old and valued friend,
Mr. Coutts, the opulent banker, with whom he had been acquainted nearly
sixty years. This gentleman had on many occasions afforded him valuable
proofs of his sincere friendship. With him, and with his family during
the latter period of his life, in particular, Fuseli was almost
domesticated. By them, his very wishes were anticipated, and he received
from their hands, such attentions as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span> can arise only from feelings of
respect and regard, accompanied by those comforts and elegancies which
wealth alone can bestow. And I cannot refrain from expressing my
conviction, that these attentions, which were afforded without the least
ostentation, not only contributed to make the winter of his life
pleasant, but really prolonged the existence of a man to whom the public
are so much indebted as an artist, critic, and teacher of the Fine Arts.</p>

<p>It has been often remarked, that old men do not feel so acutely the loss
of relations and friends, as those who are of a less advanced age. But
this was not the case with Fuseli; for, although now in his eighty-first
year, his faculties were unimpaired, and he still possessed a great
degree of sensibility. As one friend dropped into the grave after
another, he felt the loss of each, and constantly exclaimed, "It is my
turn next," advising me at the same time, as I advanced in life, to
cultivate the friendship of men younger than myself, that I might not be
left without friends in old age. Although when a younger man he appeared
to his acquaintances to cling much to life, yet now when he spoke of
death, it was without fearful forebodings. "Death," he used to say, "is
nothing; it is the pain and feebleness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span> body under a lingering
disease, which often precedes death, that I dread; for, at my time of
life, I can look forward but to a day, and that passes quickly." The
following extract of a letter to the Countess of Guilford, dated the
17th of November 1821, and written on his return to London with Mrs.
Fuseli, after they had passed some time at Brighton, will further show
his feelings on this subject.</p>

<p class="blockquot"><br /><span style="margin-left: 4em;">
"<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Taciti, soli, e senza compagnia</span>.</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">"We jogged on, though at a swifter pace than Dante and his

<p class="blockquot">"Indeed, were it not for those I should leave behind, I would
not care <i>if now</i>." </p>

<p class="p2">Mr. Roscoe this year (1821) visited London. From Fuseli's advanced age,
and Mr. Roscoe's weakness of body, the former anticipated that it would
be the last time they should meet&mdash;which anticipation, I believe, was
realized. A day or two after Mr. Roscoe's arrival, I received the
following note from Fuseli.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p class="inright"><br />"Sunday, 11th February, 1821.</p>

Fuseli's table; there were also present, Sir Thomas Lawrence, Mr. Lock,
Mr. Howard, R.A., Mr. J. Symmons, and Mr. Robert Roscoe. The
conversation was desultory, sometimes upon literature, at others upon
art; and at two more intellectual dinner-parties I have seldom been
present. Fuseli was animated and energetic, and shewed that he then
possessed a mind of the greatest vigour, with an unimpaired memory.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> intimates of Fuseli had observed, with much concern, that for two or
three years, although his general health did not appear to be materially
affected by age, yet there was a predisposition to water in the chest,
which usually manifested itself when he took cold, by his being
occasionally affected with some difficulty in breathing, irregularity of
pulse, and also by the swelling, in a slight degree, of his feet and
ancles. These symptoms were repeatedly removed, in a few days, by the
appropriate remedies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span> but after intervals they recurred. On the 23d
August, 1823, he sent a note to my house, early in the morning,
expressing a wish to see me immediately, which summons I promptly
obeyed. On my arrival, he said, that although when we parted at ten
o'clock the preceding evening, he did not feel at all indisposed; yet,
shortly after he had retired to bed, he found a difficulty in breathing,
such as he had never before experienced, and that his legs were much
swollen, and wished therefore to consult a friend of mine, Dr. Maton. I
told him that the Doctor was absent from London, and therefore advised
him to send for a physician with whom he and I were well acquainted,
(Sir Alexander Crichton,) to meet his friend and usual medical adviser,
Mr. Richard Cartwright; to which proposal he assented. Mrs. Fuseli was
at this time at Brighton, for the benefit of her health; and he gave me
strict injunctions not to inform her of his indisposition. But as his
medical advisers told me the disease was water in the chest, and that
the symptoms were alarming, I wrote to Mrs. Fuseli, informing her in
some degree of the facts; and, although much indisposed herself, she
came immediately to London.</p>

<p>His case, for some time, was considered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span> be almost hopeless; and Sir
Thomas Lawrence, in anxious solicitude for the safety of his friend,
advised that Dr. Holland should also be consulted. This gentleman was
fully aware of his danger, but coincided in every respect in the
propriety of the previous treatment, and said that nothing more could be
done. After three weeks of suffering, which Fuseli bore with patience
and fortitude, his spirits never having forsaken him, nature made a
great effort, and he, contrary to the expectations of his medical
attendants, rallied, and in a few weeks more was restored to a state of
comparative health.</p>

<p>During this illness, he received the visits of his particular friends in
the evening, and conversed with his usual energy; and it must have been
highly gratifying to his feelings to see the anxiety which they
manifested for his safety; more particularly the Countess of Guilford
and her two amiable daughters, the Ladies North, and also Sir Thomas
Lawrence,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> who, with the writer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span> of this account, allowed no
engagement to interfere, and were his constant companions every
evening. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>His friends who were absent from London amused him with their
letters, one of which is here transcribed.<br /></p>

grateful. He acts like your warm and constant friend.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Friendship was a quality you often extolled: the affection of
relations you used to hold cheap, as a mere instinctive
sensation; whereas friendship is a rational selection. It was
that quality which humanised Achilles, who without it would have

<p class="p2">After his recovery, it was evident that this severe illness had made an
inroad on his constitution; for, although it had no apparent effect upon
his mental energies, yet it was apparent that his bodily exertions were
enfeebled; for, when he was enabled to resume his accustomed exercise of
walking, it was not performed with that long stride and firm step for
which he had been before remarkable.</p>

<p>In the year 1824, Fuseli sat to Mr. Baily for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span> a bust, which was
executed in marble: he had always a high opinion of the talents of the
sculptor, and on this occasion said to me, "I assure you, as an artist,
that there is much more of truth, expression, and feeling, in Baily's
work than in that of his competitors, however much they may enjoy the
public favour." On this bust he had the following line chiselled:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 9em;"><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#8025;&#928;&#917;&#929;&#921;&#916;&#937;&#925; &#7945; &#925;&#933;&#925; &#7960;&#921;&#925;&#913;&#921; &#934;&#913;&#924;&#917;&#925;</span>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Lawrence also entertained a high opinion of Mr. Baily's
talents as a sculptor; and, in addition to the bust of Fuseli, had those
of Flaxman, Smirke, and Stothard chiselled by him. These were placed
among the exquisite specimens of ancient and modern art which adorned
his dining-room.</p>

<p>In the early part of 1825, he sat for a half-length portrait to Sir
Thomas Lawrence, which this great artist executed admirably. At this
time the Earl of Eldon was also sitting for his likeness, and Fuseli,
not recognizing the countenance, asked Sir Thomas who it was? who
answered, "It is the Chancellor." Fuseli took a piece of chalk, and
immediately wrote on the picture&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
<span class="i4">&mdash;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>"<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quia me vestigia terrent<br /></span></span>
<span class="i4"><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Omnia te adversum spectantia, nulla retrorsum.</span>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When Lord Eldon saw this, he was much amused; and on being told that it
was written by Fuseli, laughed heartily.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1824, I persuaded him not to lecture, which it was his
intention then to do, being apprehensive that the exertion which he must
employ would be too great for his diminished strength; in the early part
of 1825, he however delivered his last course of lectures, with
certainly less of energy of manner, but without much apparent fatigue:
he had also prepared some pictures for the ensuing exhibition at the
Royal Academy.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these proofs of remaining powers, on Sunday, the 10th of
April 1825,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span> Fuseli, being then on a visit to the Countess of Guilford
at Putney Hill, complained of indisposition, while walking in the
pleasure-grounds. He was engaged on that day to dine in St. James's
Place, with Mr. Samuel Rogers; and Lady Guilford had ordered her
carriage to convey him thither; but as his illness continued, Mrs.
Fuseli prevailed upon him (with difficulty) to remain in the house, and
he gave up the engagement. It was an affecting coincidence, that on the
evening before, being out on the lawn with the Ladies North, and looking
at the stars, which shone with great brightness, he said, (possibly from
the consciousness of symptoms which he considered dangerous,) "I shall
soon be amongst them." On the Monday, it was evident to all about him
that he was much worse, and he expressed a strong desire to see me;
being informed of his illness, I immediately went to Putney, and from
his altered appearance had great fears of what would be the issue. The
opinions of Sir Alexander Crichton and Dr. Holland, who arrived there
shortly after, confirmed my apprehensions, for they said, when
questioned by me, that "they could not give any specific name to the
complaint; for it appeared to them, that all the functions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span> nature
had given way, and, in their opinion, he could not last many days."</p>

<p>The attentions of the Countess of Guilford and her family to Fuseli were
unremitting; every thing was done by them to promote his comfort, and
even to anticipate his wishes; the question constantly asked was, "Can
nothing further be done to keep him a little longer with us?" but it was
too apparent, notwithstanding these kindnesses, and the skill and
attention of his physicians, that life was fast ebbing. I saw him every
day, and I have reason to believe that, from the commencement of his
illness, he did not expect to recover; for, on the Wednesday, he put his
hand into mine, and said, "My friend, I am fast going to that bourne
whence no traveller returns." But he neither expressed regret at his
state, nor, during his illness, shewed any despondency or impatience. I
left him at a late hour on the Friday (the evening before he died); he
was then perfectly collected, and his mind apparently not at all
impaired, but his articulation was feeble, and the last words which he
addressed to his physicians, the death guggles being then in his throat,
were in Latin: so perfect was his mind at this time, that he said to me,
"What can this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span> mean? when I attempt to speak, I croak like a toad."</p>

<p>On Saturday morning, at seven o'clock, he was told that Mr. Cartwright
was in the house: as he knew two gentlemen of that name, he was
uncertain which it was. On Mr. Cartwright approaching his bedside, he
put out his hand, and exclaimed, "Is it you, Samuel?" This gentleman
raised him in his bed, and moistened his mouth and lips with liquid, by
means of a feather, for which he feebly thanked him.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>On Mr. Cartwright's arrival in London, he immediately wrote to me,
saying, "he feared ere I received his communication that Fuseli would be
no more;" this apprehension of his was shortly afterwards confirmed by a
letter from Lady Guilford, informing me that he had breathed his last
that morning, (Saturday, the 16th of April, 1825,) at half-past ten
o'clock, without much apparent pain, and in complete possession of his
faculties; and that, in consequence, my presence, as an intimate friend
and executor, being immediately required, both by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span> Mrs. Fuseli and
herself, at Putney, she had sent her carriage to enable me to come down
without delay.</p>

<p>On my arrival at Putney Hill, I found the Countess of Guilford and the
Ladies Susan and Georgina North in deep grief. Fuseli was highly
esteemed by these ladies, and reciprocally felt towards them the warmest
friendship. He entertained for Lady Susan great regard; but he had for
Lady Georgina, that affection which a master usually feels towards an
amiable, accomplished, and highly promising pupil. This young lady had
devoted much time to the study of the Fine Arts, and, assisted by the
occasional hints and instructions of Fuseli, has arrived at eminence in
the highest branch, that of historical design. After some preliminary
observations, Lady Guilford observed, that she considered it a duty to
act upon this melancholy occasion as she was sure her father (Mr.
Coutts) would have acted were he alive; and she said, "As to
arrangements, I give you, Mr. Knowles, a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carte blanche</i>; but observe, it
is my wish, as Mr. Fuseli has died here, that his remains should be so
placed as will not disgrace a public funeral; for I feel convinced that
the Royal Academy will pay that tribute to his memory." Her Ladyship
added, (with her usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span> feelings of generosity,) "but if they fail to do
so, then I request you will order such a funeral as is due to the high
merits of the deceased; and any additional expense which may be incurred
by my wishes, I will gladly reimburse. Remember, my desire is, to have
every respect shewn to his remains." A few hours after I had returned to
London, Lady Guilford sent me in writing her instructions to the above
effect; and said in her note, that "she was induced to do so, that her
wishes and intentions might not be misunderstood."</p>

<p>Early on the Sunday morning, I called upon Sir Thomas Lawrence, not only
as a friend of the deceased, but in his official capacity as President
of the Royal Academy, to inform him of Fuseli's death, and to ask what
he considered would be the notions of the Members of the Academy with
respect to his funeral. Sir Thomas, who had been for many years the
friend and companion of Fuseli, and an admirer of his talents, met this
question with feeling and great candour, and remarked that, he knew of
no precedent for any public honours being paid to the remains of a
Keeper of the Royal Academy. I urged that there could not be a precedent
to operate in this case, for, on account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span> of the great talents of the
deceased, the Royal Academy had rendered an existing law of theirs
nugatory, by allowing him to hold the situation not only of Keeper, but
also of Professor of Painting, a compliment which had fallen to the lot
of no other man, nor was such an occurrence likely again to take place.
Sir Thomas acknowledged that he had strong claims to some distinguished
attention being paid to his remains, and promised, under this view of
the case, to convene a meeting of the Council immediately, to take the
matter into consideration.</p>

<p>After this interview, I went to Putney Hill, for the purpose of removing
the corpse to Somerset House; and in the evening, followed the remains
of Fuseli there, where Mr. Balmanno, the other executor named in the
will, was ready to receive the body. It was, at our desire, placed in a
room, around the walls of which were arranged "The Lazar-house," "The
Bridging of Chaos," and other sublime productions of his pencil, the
subjects being chiefly from Milton.</p>

<p>The Council of the Royal Academy met, in conformity to the summons of
their President, and came to the resolution,&mdash;to "recommend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span> to the
Academicians, at their general assembly about to be called for the
purpose, that the President, the Secretary, and Council, should be
desired to attend the funeral of Mr. Fuseli." The feeling, however, of
many of the Academicians at this general meeting is said to have been,
that this recommendation was not a sufficient honour to the memory of so
distinguished an artist and professor; for "the remembrance of his gibes
and his quillets," which had annoyed many while he lived, was now sunk
in death. But as the Members did not wish to disturb the resolution of
their Council, it was confirmed.</p>

<p>A curious coincidence took place at this meeting, with that convened in
the year 1792 for the purpose of considering how the funeral of Sir
Joshua Reynolds should be conducted. I allude to an objection of one
member only, in each case, to the honours proposed. With respect to the
funeral of Sir Joshua, an architect of considerable abilities and great
celebrity, (Sir William Chambers) considered it a <i>matter of duty</i> to
object to the body lying in state, and a public funeral taking place
from Somerset House, without the sanction of the King; for, said he, "My
instructions, as surveyor of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span> building, are, that the Academy cannot
let or lend any part thereof, for any other purpose than that for which
it is appropriated." This objection, it is well known, was referred to
and overruled by the King. In the case of Fuseli, an Academician, a
portrait painter, objected both in the council and at the general
assembly to any honour being paid by the Academy, as a body, to the
remains of Fuseli. But the observations of this person, I have been
credibly informed, created feelings little short of disgust in many of
the Academicians present.</p>

<p>As the funeral was, by this resolution, to be considered a private one,
measures were immediately taken by the executors, to meet the wishes of
the relative and a friend of the deceased, by ordering such preparations
to be made at their expense as they considered due to his merits; and
invitations were accordingly sent, by their desire, to the President,
Secretary, and other members of the Council of the Academy, and to
several of his private friends, to attend the solemnity.</p>

<p>The funeral of Fuseli took place on Monday the 25th of April: it moved
from Somerset House at eleven o'clock in the morning, for St. Paul's
Cathedral, in the following order:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">The hearse was followed by eight mourning coaches drawn each by four

In the others were the President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Council of
the Academy, and the private friends of the deceased, in the following

of St. Alban's), Marquis of Bute, Countess of Guilford; each drawn by
four horses, with the servants in state liveries. Lord Rivers; Lord

Admiral Sir Graham Moore; Sir Thomas Lawrence; Dr. Symmons; Mr. Lock;
Mr. Richard Cartwright; Mr. Smirke, and Mr. Wyatville.</p>

<p>The body was deposited in a small vault formed for the purpose, in the
crypt of St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span> Paul's Cathedral, between those which contain the remains
of his friends, Sir Joshua Reynolds and Opie.</p>

<p>On our return to the Royal Academy, the will was opened, with the
contents of which I was previously acquainted, as Fuseli consulted me
when he made it; and the following is a copy:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot"><br />"I, Henry Fuseli, Keeper of the Royal Academy, of London, being
in health and of sound mind, do make this my last will and
testament. I do hereby leave and bequeath unto my wife, Sophia
Fuseli, all money and every other description of property that I
may be possessed of at the time of my decease, to be for her own
and sole use. And I do hereby constitute and I appoint, John
Knowles of the Navy Office, and Robert Balmanno, of Mornington
Place, Hampstead Road, Esquires, as Executors to this my last
Will and Testament, revoking all other Wills and Testaments.
Given under my hand and seal, this twenty-first day of November,
in the year of our Lord One thousand eight hundred and
twenty-two.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">In carrying this Will into execution, a difference of opinion arose
between Mr. Balmanno and myself respecting the propriety of disposing of
some of the property by private contract; and the matter was accordingly
referred to Mrs. Fuseli. As this lady gave her assent to the view which
I had taken of the affair, Mr. Balmanno, in consequence, renounced the
trust. The Will was therefore proved by me, solely, in the Prerogative
Court of Canterbury, on the 7th September 1825.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">It</span> may now be proper to give some description of Fuseli's person and
habits. He was rather short in stature, about five feet two inches in
height, his limbs were well proportioned, his shoulders broad, and his
chest capacious. His complexion was fair; his forehead broad; his eyes
were large, blue, and peculiarly expressive and penetrating; his nose
large, and somewhat aquiline; his mouth was rather wide; and although
his features were not strictly regular, yet his countenance was, in the
highest degree, intelligent and energetic; the expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span> of his face
varied in a remarkable manner with the quick impressions of his mind. He
was clean and neat in his person and dress, and very particular with his
hair, which was carefully dressed every day with powder.</p>

<p>In youth, Fuseli was exceedingly temperate in all his habits: until the
age of twenty-one years he had never tasted fermented liquors; and in
more advanced age, his usual beverage was Port wine, in a moderate
quantity, or Port wine mixed with water; and during the whole of his
life he had never even tasted beer. He was habitually an early riser. In
London, during the summer months, he usually left his bed-room between
six and seven o'clock; but when in the country, he arose between four
and five. To these, and to the practice of standing while he painted, he
attributed the more than usual good state of health which he had
enjoyed. He possessed his faculties in an extraordinary degree to the
last period of his life: his fancy was vivid, his memory unimpaired, and
his eye-sight so good, that he could read the smallest print without the
aid of glasses: if any one of them had failed, it was his hearing; but
this, if impaired at all, was only so in a slight degree; and, in my
opinion, his complaint of this proceeded rather from inattention,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span> on
his part, to any discourse which did not interest him, than from a
defect in the organ; for, when his attention was drawn to a subject, or
excited, this was in no degree apparent.</p>

<p>Although Fuseli had a great dislike to sit for his portrait, there are
the following busts and pictures of him:&mdash;A bust in marble, chiselled
when he was in Italy; of the merits of this he always spoke in high
terms, and it is supposed to be now in Rome. A portrait in profile, by
Northcote, taken at Rome in 1778, in the possession of James Carrick
Moore, Esq. A drawing by Sir Thomas Lawrence, in 1787, made for the
translation of Lavater's physiognomy. A portrait by Williamson, of
Liverpool, in 1789, in the possession of William Roscoe, Esq. A picture
by Opie, in 1800, which Mrs. Fuseli now has. A very characteristic
miniature, by Haughton, taken in 1808, in the collection of the Countess
of Guilford; and there are two or three subsequent miniatures by the
same artist. An elaborate portrait in oil colours, by Harlow, painted in
1817, in the possession of the writer of this memoir; and one less
wrought, by the same artist, for Mr. Balmanno. A bust in marble,
executed by Baily, in 1824, for Sir Thomas Lawrence. A portrait by Sir
Thomas Lawrence, taken in 1825,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span> a few weeks before Fuseli's death, is
now in the possession of that gentleman's executor. And a bust in clay,
modelled from a cast of the face, taken after death, by Mr. Baily, for
the Countess of Guilford.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding some eccentricities, Fuseli was a man of method: his
daily occupations, which were almost unalterable, will give some notion
of this. If the weather were favourable, he usually walked for an hour
or two before breakfast; if otherwise, he read some classic author. At
breakfast (which generally occupied an hour), he was engaged in looking
over drawings of entomology, or in reading some book on that science.
After he had breakfasted, and while under the hands of the hair-dresser,
he read Homer in Greek. At half-past ten o'clock he went to his study,
and engaged himself in painting until four; then dressed, and walked
till the time appointed for dinner. In the evening, if not in society,
he amused himself in examining prints, executing drawings, or reading
the popular works of the time. When out of London, the middle of each
day was spent either in drawing, writing, or reading.</p>

<p>From infancy, Fuseli possessed very impetuous passions, which required,
when a boy, some degree of coercion, on the part of his parents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span> to
control. This irritability, in one instance, nearly cost him his life.
At Lyons, when a young man, he had a dispute with a person, which
aroused his feelings to such a height, that in a momentary fit of
passion he made use of that agility which he possessed in a considerable
degree, and kicked his antagonist in the face. The man coolly drew his
sword, and immediately inflicted a very severe wound upon the offending
leg. Notwithstanding this violence of disposition, when his anger was
aroused even to a high pitch, a kind word or look appeased him in a
moment. In the several relations of husband, friend, and master, he was
most affectionate and kind; but he required to be sought: if neglected,
he ceased to think of the objects whom he had before loved or esteemed;
and his constant theme was on such occasions, "I can live without them
who can do without me."</p>

<p>He possessed such a degree of pride and self-love in this particular,
that if he thought himself slighted, he would resent it, whatever might
be the rank or condition of the man: this has been witnessed on several
occasions, one of which now recurs to my memory. I accompanied him to a
private view of a picture, "The Trial of Queen Caroline;" after we had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
been in the room a few minutes, he pointed out a clergyman, and said,
"That is Howley, the Bishop of London; he and I were very intimate.
Before he became a dignitary of the church, he used to come to my house
frequently, and sit there for hours together; but for some years he
seems to forget even my person." Shortly after, Lord Rivers came into
the apartment, and accosted Fuseli in his usual jocular manner, and
perhaps not knowing that he had been acquainted with the Bishop, took an
opportunity of introducing him. Fuseli immediately said, "I have seen
his Lordship before now," and turned upon his heel.</p>

<p>It has been shewn, that Fuseli was educated for the clerical profession,
and as a requisite for this, he studied the classics in early life, in
order to attain a knowledge of what are called the learned languages:
taste led him to continue this study, in which he afterwards proved so
eminent; he wrote Latin and Greek accurately, and has often puzzled
learned Professors in their attempts to discover whence the passages
were derived, when he clothed his own original thoughts in classical
language. He was not ignorant of Hebrew; but in this, when compared with
Greek and Latin, his knowledge was superficial. In modern languages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span> he
was deeply skilled; for he wrote French, Italian, German, and English,
with equal facility. On one occasion, when I saw him writing a letter in
French, I made the remark, "With what ease, Sir, you appear to write
that language!" he answered, "I always think in the language in which I
write, and it is a matter of indifference to me whether it be in
English, French, or Italian; I know each equally well; but if I wish to
express myself with power, it must be in German;"&mdash;in which he has left
several pieces of poetry. For the pleasure of reading Sepp's work on
insects, he gained, late in life, a competent knowledge of Dutch:
indeed, he had a peculiar facility of acquiring languages; for in this
particular his capacity was most extraordinary. He has told me, that,
with his knowledge of general grammar, and with his memory, six weeks of
arduous study was quite sufficient time to acquire any language with
which he was previously unacquainted. This capacity was evidently owing,
in a great degree, to his quickness of perception, and to his possessing
a most retentive memory; not of that kind, however, that easily commits
to it particular passages for <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vivâ voce</i> repetition, and are lost as
soon as the object for which they were gotten is passed by; on the
contrary, what he once attained was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span> seldom or never forgotten. It was a
recollection of words as well as things: one or two examples of this
will suffice. His friend Bonnycastle also possessed great powers of
memory, and he, at Mr. Johnson's table, challenged Fuseli to compete
with him: this was immediately accepted. The best mode of trial was
submitted to Johnson, who proposed that each should endeavour to learn
by heart, in the shortest time, that part of the eleventh book of
Paradise Lost which describes a vision shewn to Adam by Michael. Fuseli
read this description of the cities of the earth, which is long, and,
from the words having little apparent connexion, difficult to be
remembered, only three times over, and he then repeated it without an
omission or error. Bonnycastle immediately acknowledged himself to be
vanquished. When "The Pursuits of Literature" were published, the public
were anxious to discover the author, and a friend said to Fuseli, "You
ought to know who it is, because he quotes you as authority for one or
two of his remarks," and mentioned the passages. Fuseli instantly
answered, "It must be Mathias; for I recollect that particular
conversation;" and stated the time, the place, and the occasion which
drew it forth, although many years had elapsed.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>Fuseli's acquaintance with English poetry and literature was very
extensive; few men recollected more of the text, or understood better
the works of Chaucer, Spenser, Shakspeare, Milton, and Dryden. In
Shakspeare and Milton he was deeply read, and he had gained some
knowledge of the merits of the former in early life from the
translations into German of some of the plays of Shakspeare, by his
tutor Bodmer, who was well read in English poetry, and who subsequently
gave a translated "Paradise Lost." Notwithstanding the predilection
which Fuseli had for the ancients, particularly Homer, yet he considered
the three first acts of "Hamlet," and the second book of "Paradise
Lost," to be the highest flights of human genius. Indeed, he had a
decided preference for poetry and works of imagination. "England," he
once said, "has produced only three genuine poets, Shakspeare, Milton,
and Dryden." A friend asked, "What do you say of Pope?"&mdash;"Ay, ay," he
interrupted, "with Broome, Cawthorne, Yalden, Churchill, Dyer, Sprat,
and a long list of contemptibles. These are favourites, I know, and they
may be poets to you; but, by Heaven, they are none to me." Another
gentleman who was present, maintained the genius of Pope, and thought
the "Dunciad" his best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span> production. Fuseli denied this, and added, "Pope
never shewed poetic genius but once, and that, in the 'Rape of the
Lock.'&mdash;A poet is an inventor; and what has Pope invented, except the
Sylphs? In the Dunciad, he flings dirt in your face every minute. Such a
performance may be as witty as you please, but can never be esteemed a
first-rate poem."&mdash;He then called his "Eloisa to Abelard," "hot ice."</p>

<p>For Gray, however, he had a high admiration; and when his opinion was
asked by one who imagined that he held him cheap, he said, "How! do you
think I condemn myself so much as not to admire Gray? Although he has
written but little, that little is done well."</p>

<p>When Addison was mentioned, he exclaimed, "Addison translated the fourth
Georgic of Virgil, except the story of Aristæus; you may thence know
what his taste was. How can you ask me about a man who could translate
that Georgic, and omit the most beautiful part?"</p>

<p>Of the more modern poets, Lord Byron was his favourite; and he always
read his writings as soon as they were published, with great avidity.
When pressed to read the works of those writers in verse who are admired
merely for the beauty of language and smoothness of versification, he
exclaimed, "I cannot find time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span> for I do not yet know every word in
Shakspeare and Milton."</p>

<p>He was well versed also in the works of foreign poets; but of these,
Dante was his favourite, for his imagery made the deepest impression on
his mind, and afforded many subjects for his daring pencil. "There was
but one instance," he said, "in which Dante betrayed a failure in moral
feeling. It is when Frate Alberigo, lying in misery in Antenora,
implores him to remove the ice from his face. Dante promises to do so,
on this condition&mdash;that the sinner shall first inform him who he is, and
for what crime he is punished. But after Alberigo has fulfilled the
conditions, the poet refuses to render him the service he had promised.
That is bad, you know; faith should be kept, even with a poor devil in
Antenora." After a pause, he burst out with Dante's description of the
Hypocrite's Punishment&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">O in eterno faticoso manto</span>!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"How well this is! I feel the weight, though I'm no hypocrite."</p>

<p>He did not accord with the feelings of Rousseau, in an epithet bestowed
on Metastasio, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"Le bouillant Metastasio!"</i>&mdash;"I do not know where he
discovered this fire; I am sure Metastasio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span> never burnt my fingers, yet
he is sometimes beautiful." Fuseli continued, "<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">I tuoi strali terror de'
mortali</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> (the Coro in the Olimpiade.) These are grand lines."</p>

<p>His knowledge of history and its attendant chronology, was accurate and
extensive, and few men understood and remembered better the heathen
mythology, and ancient and modern geography.</p>

<p>He was not ignorant of natural history; but that branch which was
cultivated by him with the greatest ardour, was entomology, in which he
was deeply informed, particularly in the classes <i>lepidoptera</i> and
<i>coleoptera</i>, but in the former he took the greatest delight; and in
acquiring a knowledge of the habits of insects, he was naturally led
into the consideration of their food; hence he was not unlearned in
botany. By skill and care, he sometimes reared in his house some of the
rarer English insects, among them, the <i>Sphinx atropos</i>, <i>Sphinx
uphorbiæ</i>, and others. His great love for entomology induced him
occasionally to introduce moths into his pictures, which he painted with
great care and fidelity, and when much taken with the subject, he made
them frequently incongruous. Thus, in a picture of Lycidas, from the
passage in Milton,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
<span class="i4">"Under the opening eye-lids of the morn,</span><br />
<span class="i4">What time the grey-fly winds his sultry horn,"</span>
</div></div>

<p>which is in the possession of James Carrick Moore, Esq., where the
shepherd and shepherdess, (exercising the licence of a painter, he has
introduced the latter,) are only ten inches in length, happening to find
in Mr. Johnson's garden at Fulham, a beautiful moth, he was so delighted
with the insect, that in spite of all propriety and his better
knowledge, he painted it the size of nature, hovering above the figures,
with expanded wings. This singular appearance in the picture attracted
the notice of the celebrated Dr. Jenner, who was skilled also in
entomology; and being invited to dinner to meet Fuseli, he consequently
enquired the subject. Mr. Moore informed him, that it was from Milton's
Lycidas, and from the line,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"What time the grey-fly winds his sultry horn."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"No, no," replied the Doctor, "this is no greyfly, but a moth, and winds
no horn; it is a mute." Fuseli, who heard this remark, knew well its
accuracy, and therefore said nothing; and the respect which he had
already entertained for Dr. Jenner, in consequence of his well-known
discovery, which has been so useful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span> to mankind, was heightened, by
finding that he possessed also a knowledge of his favourite study; and
each was amused during the evening by the other's singularities.</p>

<p>It must be acknowledged that Fuseli was fully sensible of his various
acquirements, and never underrated his own powers; although apt to
undervalue those of others, particularly of some of his brother artists,
and also to speak of them slightingly, because they were unacquainted
with literature and even deficient in orthography: after talking with
them, he has said, "I feel humbled, as if I were one of them." Mrs.
Wollstonecraft was alive to this weakness in Fuseli's character, and on
one occasion emphatically exclaimed, "I hate to see that reptile Vanity
sliming over the noble qualities of your heart." This feeling with
regard to several of the artists,&mdash;for he esteemed the acquirements of
others,&mdash;was not given in reference to their powers as painters, for he
had a high opinion of the English school of art in some of its branches.
Of Sir Thomas Lawrence he has said to me, "The portraits of Lawrence are
as well if not better drawn, and his women in a finer taste, than the
best of Vandyck's; and he is so far above the competition of any
painter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span> in this way in Europe, that he should put over his study, to
deter others, who practise this art, from entering,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">'<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Lasciate ogni speranza voi ch' entrate</span>.'"</span><br />
</p>

<p>Of Turner, he has observed, "he is the only landscape-painter of genius
in Europe." Wilkie, he considered "to have most of the qualities of the
best painters of the Dutch school, with much more of feeling and truth;"
and that "some of the fanciful pictures of Howard have poetic feeling
with fine colouring."</p>

<p>Fuseli seldom or never concealed his sentiment with regard to men, even
to their faces. Calling upon him one evening, I found Mr. Marchant and
Mr. Nollekens in his room: although I was well-known to these gentlemen,
he formally took me up to them, and said, "This, Mr. Knowles, is Mr.
Marchant, that, Mr. Nollekens, two of the cleverest artists in their
way, I believe, in Europe, but in every thing else, two old daddies."
Every one knows, who is acquainted with art, the powers which Northcote
displays when he paints animals of the brute creation. When his picture
of "Balaam and the Ass" was exhibited at the "Macklin Gallery,"
Northcote asked Fuseli's opinion of its merits, who instantly said, "My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
friend, you are an Angel at an ass, but an ass at an Angel."</p>

<p>The conversational powers of Fuseli were extraordinarily great, and it
was his constant aim to shine in company. He was, however, very averse
to protracted discussions, and for a short period would sometimes take
the weaker side of the argument, in order to shew his powers; but if he
then found his antagonist too strong for him, he often resorted to some
witty retort, and dropped the conversation. In society he could not bear
a rival; and was dissatisfied if he were prevented from taking a part in
the conversation. Shortly after Mrs. Godwin's marriage, she invited him
to dinner to meet Horne Tooke, Curran, Grattan, and two or three other
men of that stamp; he had no objection to their political opinions, but
as they engrossed the whole conversation, and that chiefly on politics,
he suddenly retired from their company, and, joining Mrs. Godwin in the
drawing-room, petulantly said to her, "I wonder you invited me to meet
such wretched company."</p>

<p>His sentiments in society were delivered with an extraordinary rapidity;
his language was nervous, and his words well chosen. He possessed much
wit, sometimes of the playful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span> but more frequently of the caustic kind;
and his ideas were often uncommon, and generally amusing, which being
poured forth with an enunciation and energy peculiar to himself, very
much increased their effect. Fuseli was quite aware that he expressed
himself sometimes too acrimoniously, and, after due consideration, he
frequently regretted it. In a letter to his friend Roscoe, he thus
expresses himself:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">"It was not necessary that I should be informed by our mutual
friend, that your affection for me continues unabated, although,
perhaps, you were a little startled by the <i>ferocity</i> of my
conversation during your last visit in town. Affection built on
the base which I flatter myself ours is founded on, cannot be
brushed away by the roughness or petulance of a few unguarded
words." </p>

<p class="p2">Again, to Mr. Ottley, he writes:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">"<span class="smcap">my dear ottley</span>,</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">"<span class="smcap">My</span> wife tells me I behaved ill to you last night, and insists
upon my making an apology for it: as I suspect she may be right,
accept my thanks for your forbearance and good-humour, and grant
me the benefit of Hamlet's excuse for his rashness to Laertes.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">"Let us see you as soon as possible again. Respects to Mrs.
Ottley.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 10em;">
"Ever yours,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">"<span class="smcap">Henry Fuseli</span>."</span></p>

<p class="insmall">"Tuesday, July 27th, 1813."
</p>


<p class="p2">Some anecdotes, in addition to those already given, will illustrate
better the nature and force of his conversational talents, than any
farther description. Discoursing one day with a gentleman at Mr.
Johnson's table upon the powers and merit of Phocion; a stranger, who
had apparently listened with attention to the conversation, interrupted
him by putting this question, "Pray, Sir, who was Mr. Phocion?" Fuseli
immediately answered, "From your dialect, Sir, I presume you are from
Yorkshire; and if so, I wonder you do not recollect Mr. Phocion's name,
as he was Member for your County in the Long Parliament;" and he then
resumed the discourse. Bonnycastle and another mathematician were
conversing upon the infinite extension of space, a subject in which
Fuseli could take no part, so as to shew his powers: he instantly cut it
short, by asking, "Pray, Gentlemen, can either of you tell me how much
broad cloth it will take to make Orion a pair of breeches?" Calling one
morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span> upon Mr. Johnson, he found him engaged in bargaining with an
author for the copyright of a book; after a time, the gentleman took
leave; when he was gone, Mr. Johnson said, "That is Mr. Kett, and his
work is to be called the 'Elements of Useful Knowledge.'" "In how many
volumes?" said Fuseli. "In two octavos," was the answer. "No, no,
Johnson," said he, "you cannot be serious; the Ocean is not to be
emptied with a tea-spoon." Meeting with a gentleman in society, who
piqued himself upon his knowledge of poetry, and boasted of being
thoroughly versed in Shakspeare, he exclaimed, in a sonorous tone,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"O, for a Muse of fire, that would ascend<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The brightest Heaven of invention!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Pray, Sir, do you happen to recollect where these lines are to be
found?" He took some time to consider, and then answered, "Somewhere in
Pope."&mdash;"I find you are well read in the Poets," said
Fuseli.&mdash;Discoursing with a lady upon sculpture, who, however, was too
well read in the classics to be a subject of his mischievous pleasantry,
he pretended to inform her of a fine bas-relief which had been received
by the Royal Academy from Rome. "What is the subject?" she
asked.&mdash;"Hector and Andromache,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span> said he, "dashing out against a wall,
the little Astyanax's brains." "Poh! why do you tell me such stuff?"
said she. "Ay! <i>you</i> may laugh," replied Fuseli, "but it would go down
with many a one. I have often said such things in company without
detection; only try it yourself at the next lord's house you may visit,
and see how many fine ladies and dandies will detect you."</p>

<p>His powers in conversation were usually greater than those displayed in
his writings, for in the latter he was always hesitating, and generally
aiming at terseness, to convey his meaning in the fewest possible words;
hence he was sometimes ambiguous, and often obscure. I ventured once to
hint this to him, and he answered, "I endeavour to put as much
information into a page, as some authors scatter through a chapter; and
you know, 'that words are the daughters of earth, and things, the sons
of heaven;' and by this sentiment I am guided."</p>

<p>Little can now be gathered, after such a lapse of years, of his
oratorical powers in the pulpit. But his friend Lavater says, "Nature
designed him for a great orator:" we must then bow to the authority of a
man of his eminence, who had frequently heard Fuseli preach. He,
however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span> delivered the powerful language in which his lectures are
written in a strong voice, with proper emphasis, and with precision.
Their effect, however, was in some degree lost to those who were not
accustomed to his German pronunciation.</p>

<p class="bgft">His want of taste for mathematics and the pure physical sciences, and
consequent ignorance of them, has been noticed, and this led him into
some incongruities in his paintings. In a picture of Lycidas, which he
was executing for Mr. Carrick Moore, he introduced the sun just rising
above the horizon, with a full moon, not in opposition to the sun, but
upon the same side. Mr. Moore attempted to convince Fuseli that the moon
never appeared full but when she was diametrically opposite to the sun:
but failing in this, he advised him to consult his friend Bonnycastle,
the Astronomer, upon the point. Some time after, Mr. Moore saw the
picture again, and found that the full moon was changed to a
crescent.&mdash;"Ho! ho!" said he, "so, Bonnycastle has convinced you of your
error?" "No such thing," answered Fuseli. "He did not say the full moon
was wrong; but, as she appears inclined to her quadrature, that it was
as well to paint her so; and I have done it."</p>

<p class="blockquot">Fuseli's inherent shyness of disposition.&mdash;His opinions of
various noted individuals, viz. Dr. Johnson, Sterne, Sir Joshua
Reynolds, Gibbon, Horne Tooke, and Thomas Paine.&mdash;His
cultivation of English notions and habits.&mdash;His attachment to
civil and religious liberty.&mdash;His intimacy with theatrical
matters.&mdash;His adventure at a Masquerade.&mdash;His powers as a
Critic, both in Literature and Art, with various illustrative
examples.&mdash;His impressions of Religion.&mdash;One of his Letters on
Literature. </p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> professional excellence, ready wit, great learning and acquirements
in the classics and general literature, which Fuseli possessed, made his
society coveted; and he might have associated with men of the highest
rank and greatest talents of his time. But from childhood, he was of a
very shy disposition, and not apt to make new acquaintances. When a boy,
if a stranger happened to visit at his father's house, he would run away
and hide himself; and with a similar feeling, through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span> life, he
contented himself with the association and attentions of old and tried
friends, without attempting to make new acquaintances; and has often
refused a pleasant dinner-party to meet some known friends, if he
understood that one or two strangers were invited to be of the party.
This shyness gave to many the notion that he was a man of morose
disposition, of severity of conduct, and of uncouth manners. But they
who enjoyed his friendship, witnessed his domestic habits and happiness,
and thus had opportunities of forming an accurate opinion of the good
qualities of his heart and mind, know well the erroneousness of these
opinions.</p>

<p>Fuseli would often be very amusing by giving anecdotes, and sometimes
his opinion, of the merits of several of the literary characters whom he
had met in company, or with whom he had associated. A few of his
remarks, in addition to those already given, recur to memory. Of Dr.
Johnson, whom he sometimes saw at Sir Joshua Reynolds' table, he said,
"Johnson had to a physiognomist a good face, but he was singular in all
his movements; he was not so uncouth in appearance and manners as has
been represented by some; he sat at table in a large bushy wig and brown
coat, and behaved decently enough.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span> On one occasion, the conversation
turned upon ghosts and witches, in the existence of which he believed,
and his only argument was, "that great and good men in all times had
believed in them." My fingers itched to be at him, but I knew, if I got
the better of the argument, that his celebrity was so great, it would
not be credited.&mdash;"You know," he continued, "that I hate superstition.
When I was in Switzerland, speaking with Lavater upon the appearance of
the spirit after death, it was agreed between us, that if it were
allowed by the Deity to visit earth, the first who died should appear to
the other; my friend was the most scrupulous man in existence, with
regard to his word; he is dead, and I have not seen him."&mdash;Of Sterne he
said, that "he was a good man, knew what was right, and had excellent
qualities, but was weak in practice. When I was invited to meet him at
Johnson's, I expected to hear from the author of 'The Sentimental
Journey,' (which I esteem the most original of books,) either wit, or
pathos, or both; when I saw him, he was certainly nearly worn out, and I
was miserably disappointed, as nothing then seemed to please him but
talking obscenely."&mdash;The description which he gave of Sir Joshua
Reynolds was, "that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span> he had an insignificant face, but he possessed
quickness of apprehension; he was no scholar, and a bad speaker. In his
art, he took infinite pains at first to finish his work; but afterwards,
when he had acquired a greater readiness of hand, he dashed on with his
brush. "There is a degree of arrogance," said he, "in Sir Joshua's
portraits, for all his boys are men, his girls women. Sir Joshua,
unassisted with a sitter, had no idea of a face; he copied nature, and
yet there is a perfect degree of originality in his paintings; he had
the affectation to deny genius." Of Gibbon he remarked, "that he had a
good forehead, but a measured way of studying whatever he said." Of
Horne Tooke,&mdash;"Tooke is undoubtedly a man of talents; but he is the
greatest chatterer I ever sat down with; one cannot, in his company, put
in a word edgewise; he, however, wishes to be thought a good German
scholar, but in this he is very superficial." He sometimes met Thomas
Paine in society, and has remarked to me, "that he was far from being
energetic in company; to appreciate his powers, you must read his works,
and form your opinion from them, and not from his conversation. Paine
knew less of the common concerns of life than I do, who know little; for
when he has had occasion to remove from lodgings, he hardly knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span> how to
procure or make an agreement for others, and our friend Johnson<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
latterly managed these concerns for him. When the popular cry was much
against Paine, it was thought prudent by his friends, that he should
remove from his apartments; and others were taken for him by Johnson,
about four miles distant from those which he inhabited. They went there
in a hackney-coach, for such a vehicle could contain them, with all the
moveables which Paine possessed. On their arrival at the new abode,
Paine discovered that half a bottle of brandy was left behind; now
brandy being an important thing to Paine, he urged Johnson to drive back
to fetch it. 'No, Mr. Paine,' said he, 'it would not be right to spend
eight shillings in coach-hire, to regain one shilling's-worth of
brandy.' Paine was an excellent mechanic; when Sharpe was about to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
engrave my picture of 'The Contest of Satan, Sin, and Death,' he
employed a carpenter to construct a roller to raise or fall it at
pleasure; in this, after several ineffectual attempts, he did not
succeed to the expectations of Sharpe, who mentioned the circumstance in
the hearing of Paine; he instantly offered his services, and set to work
upon it, and soon accomplished all, and indeed more than the engraver
had anticipated."</p>

<p>In his notions and habits, Fuseli was completely an Englishman; and
although, when he spoke, no one could take him for such, yet he disliked
to be thought a foreigner; and he has sometimes said to me, "When I
speak in any of the established languages of Europe, I am every where
considered a foreigner, even when I discourse in German, our language at
Zurich being a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Patois</i>; but I can assure you that this is nervous, and
not without its beauties." No man was a greater stickler for civil and
religious liberty than Fuseli, and no man had a deeper horror of the
slave trade, or a greater dislike to impressing seamen. Paying a visit
to his friend Roscoe, at Liverpool, in the year 1804, this gentleman
pointed out to him all the improvements which had been made in the town
since he was there last, which was within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span> a few years. He observed, "I
do not wonder that you look upon these with some degree of
self-complacency; for they may be considered as the work of your hands,
and as such I view them with interest; but methinks I every where smell
the blood of slaves."<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Fuseli esteemed the English character more highly than that of any other
country, and was much pleased with their amusements. The theatre was a
constant source of gratification, and his criticisms on plays and
players were usually severe, but generally acute and just. Meeting
Macklin at Johnson's table, he shewed such deep knowledge in the art in
which that celebrated man was so successful, not only as a writer, but
as an actor, that when Fuseli took his leave, Macklin exclaimed, "I
could sit all night to discourse with that learned Theban." Of Miss
O'Neill he always spoke favourably, and considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span> that her merits as
an actress, however highly they were esteemed, had been undervalued
rather than overrated. Of Mr. Betty, in 1822, he said, "If his face, on
the whole, do not sanction a prophecy of unrivalled excellence, it does
not exclude him from attaining eminence. Mrs. Pritchard was the allowed
Lady Macbeth of her day, without one tragic feature, or one elegant
limb. It is indeed a little provoking, that he who in Dublin inthralled
the general female eye, when his golden locks inundated his neck,&mdash;he
whose kerchief the <i>ladies</i> at Bath of late cut out into a thousand
amulets of love, should be less than the theatric sun of London;&mdash;but

<p>If I have murdered Horace's verse, I have improved the sense. As to
former actors, the pupils of Betterton and Booth would probably have
turned up their noses at Barry and Garrick&mdash;'But to praise the past,'
has always been a characteristic of age." He was an admirer of Kean in
some characters which he played, particularly in his Shylock. But he
considered that this actor took too wide a range. In writing to a
friend, he says, "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span> have seen Kean and Mrs. West in Orestes and
Hermione, and desire to see <i>them</i> no more. What could excite the public
rapture at his first appearance in this part, I am at a loss to guess:
if his figure is not absolutely irreconcileable with the character, his
action and expression are balanced between the declamation of Talma, the
ravings of a bedlamite, and sometimes the barking of a dog. Mrs. West is
something of a slender Grecian figure, tall, not ungraceful, and a face
something like Mrs. Madyn's: she was well dressed, and has a good voice,
but no rule of it, and tore her part to tatters in one uninterrupted fit
of raving." In the Italian opera, and in operas in general, he did not
take much delight; for in music his ear was certainly imperfect; but
notwithstanding this, some few simple airs affected him strongly. In
speaking of music, he said, "All your complicated harmonies of Haydn and
Beethoven are fine, I know; because they are esteemed to be so by the
best judges; but I am ignorant, and they say nothing to me. They give to
me no more pleasure than a fine anatomical foreshortened drawing by
Michael Angelo would to an unpractised eye. But the song, 'How imperfect
is expression,' is the key to my heart. How could a Frenchman write<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span> it?
Lady Guilford once sang it to me so exquisitely, that I only wished to
hear it over and over again, and to die when it ceased." He always held
an opinion, that the English and French, as nations, possessed no genius
or taste for music, and that their apparent attachment to this science
was assumed, and not natural. Of masquerades, he considered that
Englishmen neither possess the animal spirits nor quickness of repartee
requisite for this amusement, but are apt to drop the fictitious
character they assume, and take up their real one. He instanced this by
the following anecdote:&mdash;"At the request of young Lavater, when he was
in England, I went to a masquerade at the Opera House: we were
accompanied by my wife, Mrs. Wollstonecraft, and some others, and were
endeavouring to be amused by the masks, when a devil came howling about
us, and tormented some of the party to such a degree, that I exclaimed
in a loud voice, 'Go to hell!' but the dull devil, instead of answering
in character, 'Then I will drag you down with me,' or making some bitter
retort, put himself into a real passion, and began to abuse me roundly.
So I, to avoid him, retired from the place, and left the others of the
party to battle it out."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>

<p>As a critic, Fuseli's powers can be best estimated by his writings. In
art&mdash;his "Lectures," "Notes to Pilkington's Dictionary," his
"Aphorisms," and "The Fragment of a History of Art," may be instanced.
In the classics&mdash;but more particularly in Greek,&mdash;by the written
opinions of Cowper, and the oral testimony given in society, by Porson,
Parr, Burney, Symmons, and others. In consequence of his extensive
knowledge in the dead languages, the situation of "Professor of Ancient
Literature" to the Royal Academy became nearly a sinecure, as he
afforded information upon all classical subjects, and furnished the
mottoes for the annual catalogues of the exhibition, which were usually
in Greek, but sometimes in Latin. He, however, kept up the most friendly
intercourse with the Professor of the time, and frequently corresponded
with him, particularly so with Dr. Charles Burney, upon disputed points
or doubtful passages. I am favoured by Dr. Charles Parr Burney with the
following letter, which Fuseli wrote to his father:&mdash;</p>

</p>

<p class="p2">Fuseli corrected many editions of Clarke's Homer, for the use of
students, as they passed through the press, and gave some notes in
Latin, to which the initial letter F. is affixed. An instance may be
offered, not only of his knowledge of this language, but of his power in
recalling words to his recollection.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span> In a Greek Lexicon which he had,
several leaves were wanting, and as an exercise to his memory, he
endeavoured to supply these in his own hand-writing, without reference
to another work.</p>

<p>In general literature, his critical knowledge may be estimated by the
numerous articles which he wrote for the Analytical Review, which are
easily to be distinguished by the peculiarity of their style; and they
generally have the initials Z. Z. affixed; but if it be necessary to
point out any in particular, for the guidance of the reader, the reviews
which have been inserted, page 81, of Cowper's Homer, and Roscoe's
Lorenzo de' Medici, may be instanced. He was not less powerful in <i
lang="la" xml:lang="la">vivá voce</i> criticisms than in his written ones;
one or two instances of this, with regard to works of art, will suffice.
In Northcote's picture of Hubert and Arthur, painted for the Shakspeare
Gallery, Hubert is represented with one hand on his brow, undetermined,
and apparently melted with the touching supplications of Arthur, who,
kneeling at his feet, is shewn clasping his knees.</p>

<p>Fuseli on seeing this picture, said, "He has taken the wrong moment, for
whoever looks at that hesitating Hubert must see that the boy is safe,
the danger past, and the interest gone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span> He should have chosen the
moment when Hubert stamps with his foot, and cries, 'Come forth; do as I
bid you;' and two ruffians should have appeared rushing in with red-hot
irons; then the scene would have been such as it ought to
be,&mdash;terrible." Condemning in general terms a large historical picture,
which a person at table had admired; he was asked for some specific
fault: "Why," said he, "the fellow has crammed into his canvass fifteen
figures, besides a horse, and, by G&mdash;d! he has given only three legs
among them." "Why, where has he hidden the others?" was asked. "How
should I know?" he answered, "I did not paint the picture; but I wonder
how any one can talk of a painter and praise him, who has given fifteen
men and a horse only three legs."</p>

<p>Shortly after the first exhibition of the works of Sir Joshua Reynolds,
at the British Institution, he wrote the following criticisms,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> among
others, upon his pictures of Ugolino, of Dido, and the Infant Hercules,
which may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span> probably be perused with interest, as they have not appeared

</div></div>
<p class="blockquot">"From whatever cause this face became that of Ugolino,&mdash;whether
its original were that of a noble or a pauper, it is a standard
of grief;&mdash;but, more habitual than sudden, the grief of one whom
"sharp misery had long worn to the bones,"&mdash;not of him whom
fortune's quick reverse dashed headlong on to despair. The
manner in which he is grouped with his infant son, as it
increases the contrast, adds to our sympathy,&mdash;which is however
obtained not only at the expense of the story, but of nature.
The whole family were shut up together in the cage; and when the
vigorous partners of the father in arms writhe in the agonies of
hunger, or, unable to support themselves, droop in languor, is
it natural to see a blooming stripling, unaffected by either, at
his ease console the petrified father?" </p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span></p>


<h4><br />THE DIDO.</h4>

<p class="blockquot">"This is one of the few historic compositions any where, and
perhaps a solitary one in this collection, of which the
principal figure is the best and occupies the most conspicuous
place. Riveted to supreme beauty in the jaws of death, we pay
little attention to the subordinate parts, and scorn, when
recovered from sympathy and anguish, to expatiate in cold
criticisms on their unfitness or impotence. He who could
conceive this Dido, could not be at a loss for a better Anna,
had he had a wish, or given himself time to consult his own
heart, rather than to adopt a precedent of clamorous grief from
Daniel di Volterra. That Iris was admitted at all, without
adequate room to display her, as the arbitress of the moment,
may be regretted; for if she could not be contrived to add
sublimity to pathos, she could be no more than what she actually
became, a tool of mean conception.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The writer of these observations has seen the progress of this
work,&mdash;if not daily, weekly,&mdash;and knows the throes which it cost
its author before it emerged into the beauty, assumed the shape,
or was divided into the powerful masses of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">chiar' oscuro</span> which
strike us now; of colour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span> it never had, nor wants, more than

</div></div>

<p class="blockquot">"The painter has proved the success of a great principle, less
understood than pertinaciously opposed."</p>


<h4><br />THE INFANT HERCULES.</h4>

<p class="blockquot">"No eminent work of art that we are acquainted with ever proved
with more irresistible evidence, the truth of Hesiod's axiom,
that "the half excels the whole," than the infant Demigod before
us; whose tremendous superiority of conception and style not
only scorns all alliance with the motley mob of whom the painter
condemned him to make a part, but cannot, with any degree of
justice, be degraded into a comparison with any figure which has
reached us, of an Infant Hercules on ancient or modern monuments
of art. Whatever homage conjecture may pay to the powers of
Xeuxis, whose "Jupiter Enthroned," and "Infant Hercules,"
tradition joins as works of equal magnificence, it will be
difficult for fancy to seek an image of loftier or more
appropriate conception than that of the heroic child before us,
whose magnitude of form, irresistibility of grasp, indignant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
disdain, and sportive ease of action, equally retain his divine
origin, and disclose the germ of the future power destined to
clear society and rid the earth of monsters.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"This infant, like the infants of Michael Angelo, and of what we
possess of the ancients, teems with the man, but without that
sacrifice of puerility observable in them. Modern art has
allotted the province of children to Fiammingo; it seems to
belong, with a less disputable title, to Reynolds, who inspired
the pulpy cheeks and milky limbs of the Fleming with the
manners, (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#7980;&#920;&#919;</span>) habits, and the mind of infancy, when first
emerging form, instinct to will, sprouts to puerility, displays
the dawn of character, and the varied symptoms of imitation; but
above all, that unpremeditated grace, the innate gift and
privilege of childhood, in countenance, attitude, and action." </p>

<p class="p2">Notwithstanding his great acquirements in the classics, acuteness of
mind, and knowledge of some of the branches of natural philosophy,
Fuseli neither solicited nor was offered any literary or other honours
(except those of the Royal Academy) in this country. Expressing one day
my surprise at this, he answered, "What are such things worth? for I
have known men on whom the honorary degree of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span> Doctor of Laws has been
conferred by the University of Oxford, which prides itself for classical
knowledge, who cannot read correctly a line in the classics; and you
know those who are Fellows of the Royal Society, who do not possess a
philosophical knowledge even of the material on which they work."</p>

<p>Fuseli was seldom induced to speak on religion; but, as he attached
himself to no particular form or sect, which is frequently the case with
foreigners, it would be difficult to give a precise idea of his tenets.
In religion, however, as well as on all other concerns, he thought for
himself, unshackled by those restraints which forms, ceremonies, or
opinions, often impose on the mind. No man that I have ever conversed
with had a higher or more sublime notion of the attributes and
benevolence of the Deity, and no one a better knowledge of the Bible. In
this book he was deeply read, and recollected, when in conversation, not
only those parts which, for historical facts, sublimity, pathos, or
poetic beauty, are impressed on most minds, but also the minor
circumstances, for he could from memory trace the several tribes, and
tell you accurately the genealogy of any particular person. He seldom
took up the Bible, which he frequently did, without shedding tears. One
evening, when talking in a serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span> mood to a young lady, he related to
her, in his own peculiar and forcible manner, the story of "Joseph and
his Brethren," and with the greatest pathos; and at that part where
Joseph falls on Benjamin's neck and wept, he burst out, while tears
trembled in his eyes, "How finely that is expressed, there are beautiful
things in that book! It's an exquisite book!" He had a perfect reliance
on a future state of existence. "If I had not hope in this," he said, "I
should hang myself, for I have lived and still live for nothing. I am
certain I shall exist hereafter, for I feel that I have had powers given
to me by the Deity, which time has not allowed me to exert or even to
develope. I am capable of doing ten times more than I have done."</p>

<p>This prevailing impression broke forth on many occasions. He had
accompanied Sir Thomas Lawrence to see a collection of fine casts from
the antique, which had recently been formed by Jens Wolff, Esq. then
Consul to his Danish Majesty, and which were arranged in a gallery built
for the purpose by Mr. Smirke, at Sherwood Lodge, Battersea.</p>

<p>In a niche, at the end of the gallery, was placed the colossal statue of
the Farnese Hercules, and by a novel arrangement of the lamps (the rest
of the gallery being in total darkness),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span> a very powerful effect was
given to the statue, which had been turned with its back to the
spectator, and thus presented a vast mass of shadow, defined only by its
grand outline and the strength of the light beyond it; the source of
which was concealed by the pedestal. Its appearance being singularly
striking, in the course of the evening, Mr. Fuseli was taken down to see
it. Sir Thomas Lawrence attended him, and for a few moments was
disappointed by the silence of his friend; but on a servant bringing a
light into the entrance-room, he perceived Fuseli excited even to tears,
as he exclaimed with deep tremulous energy, "No man shall persuade me,
that these emotions which I now feel are not immortal."</p>

<p>In farther corroboration of his opinions on this point, I may give the
following conversation which I heard. Fuseli was maintaining the
immortality of the soul; a gentleman present said, "I could make you or
any man of sense disbelieve this in half an hour's conversation." Fuseli
immediately answered, "That I am sure you could not, and I will take
care you shan't."</p>

<p>Being pressed one day by his friend, the Reverend John Hewlett; upon his
belief in the resurrection of Christ, that gentleman informs me, he
answered, "I believe in a resurrection;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span> and the resurrection of Christ
is as well authenticated as any other historical fact." Although he was
averse to religious controversy, and seldom entered into it, yet, if his
forbearance made others press the subject, he soon shewed that he was
not ignorant of the respective merits of the polemics in the Christian
Church, who have in all times broached and supported contrary opinions
upon disputed points. He has more than once said to me, "There are now
no real Christians, for the religion of Christ died with its great
Author; for where do we witness in those who bear his name, the
humility, self abasement, and charity of their master, which qualities
he not only taught, but practised?"</p>

<p>A detection of parallel passages in authors, or of similar figures in
the pictures of painters, was a favourite amusement of Fuseli's, and he
would sometimes indulge in these to the gratification and instruction of
the company by the hour together, for no man was more acute in
discovering plagiarism. I have been indulged by the kindness of a lady
of great literary attainments with the following letter, which will give
some notion of his power in this respect, as far as literature is
concerned.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>

<p class="inright"><br />"Norbury Park.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"<span class="smcap">Some</span> one, who had a right to write what he liked, even
nonsense;&mdash;Tiberius, I believe, began a letter to the Roman
senate thus: 'Conscript Fathers, you expect a letter from me;
but may all the gods and goddesses confound me, if I know on
what to write, how to begin, how to go on, or what to leave
out:' his perplexity arose certainly from a cause very different
from that which occasions mine, though the result appears to be
nearly the same. Had I brought my eyes and mind with me, I might
perhaps offer some tolerable observations on the charms that
surround me, to one who is all eye and all mind; but she who is
really possessed by one great object, is blind to all others;
and though Milton could never have been the poet of 'Paradise
Lost,' had he been born blind, blindness was of service to him
when he composed it.</p>

and judgment in the Fine Arts are so eminently conspicuous, and whose
claims to distinction are so well known to the public by his various
works.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span></p>

<p>It has been shewn throughout this memoir, that the Fine Arts was the
ruling passion of Fuseli, but that his father took more than ordinary
pains to prevent his becoming an artist, and even checked his wishes to
practise in the Fine Arts as an amusement; hence, the benefits which are
considered to arise from that early education which artists usually
receive, were altogether withheld from him. His style of drawing in
early life was formed from those prints, which he could only consult by
stealth, in his father's collection, and these were chiefly from the
German school. From this circumstance, his early works have figures
short in stature, with muscular, but clumsy limbs. But in the invention
of the subject, even in his youth, he took the most striking moment, and
impressed it with novelty and grandeur; hence some of his early
productions tell the stories which they are intended to represent, with
a wonderful felicity, and, in this respect, are little inferior to his
later works; a circumstance which he himself was not backward to
acknowledge. Fuseli always aimed to arrive at the highest point of
excellence, particularly in design, and constantly avowed it. When
young, he wrote in the Album of a friend, "I do not wish to build a
cottage, but to erect a pyramid;" and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span> this precept he adhered during
life, scorning to be less than the greatest. Until he was twenty-five
years of age, he had never used oil colours; and he was so inattentive
to these materials, that during life he took no pains in their choice or
manipulation. To set a palette, as artists usually do, was with him out
of the question; he used many of his colours in a dry, powdered state,
and rubbed them up with his pencil only, sometimes in oil alone, which
he used largely, at others, with an addition of a little spirit of
turpentine, and not unfrequently in gold size; regardless of the
quantity of either, or their general smoothness when laid on, and
depending, as it would appear to a spectator, more on accident for the
effect which they were intended to produce, than on any nice distinction
of tints in the admixture or application of the materials. It appears
doubtful whether this deficiency in his early education, and his neglect
also of mechanical means, will be detrimental to his fame as an artist,
particularly in the minds of those who can penetrate beyond the surface;
for if he had been subjected to the trammels of a school, his genius
would have been fettered; and it is then probable that we should have
lost those daring inventions, that boldness and grandeur of drawing,
(incorrect, certainly, sometimes in anatomical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span> precision,) so fitting
to his subjects, and that mystic <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">chiar' oscuro</i>, which create our wonder
and raise him to the first rank as an artist. He was always proud of
having it believed that, in the Fine Arts in particular, in some of the
languages, and in many branches of literature, he had arrived at
celebrity and eminence, more by his own unassisted endeavours than from
the instructions of others. And, in reference to this, he on one
occasion exclaimed, in the words of Glendower, with a considerable
degree of self-complacency&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Where is he living, clipped in with the sea<br /></span>
<span class="i4">That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Which calls me pupil!"<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After quitting his paternal roof, the first work of art which, as I have
before stated, appeared to impress his mind with the grandeur of its
proportions, was Rëichel's colossal figure of St. Michael, over the
gateway of the Arsenal at Augsburg; and he afterwards, from having seen
this, altered in some degree the proportions of his figures. But still,
most of the faults of the German school, in this particular,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span> remained,
until after he had visited Italy. The works of the ancients in
sculpture, the frescoes of Michael Angelo and Raphael, and the oil
paintings of the great masters of the Italian school which he studied
there, particularly the two first, produced a still greater change in
the proportions of his figures, and he founded his future works upon
them: if, however, any figure or group of figures may be quoted to have
had a greater influence in this, or to have impressed his mind with more
than ordinary notions of grandeur, the two colossal marble statues<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
by Phidias and Praxiteles upon Monte Cavallo, may be instanced; these
chiefly regulated his proportions and influenced his style, although it
must be acknowledged that, in the length of limbs, he frequently
exceeded them. I have heard him dilate upon the sensations which were
produced upon his mind when he has sometimes contemplated these grand
works of art, on an evening,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span> when the sky was murky for some distance
above the horizon, and they were illuminated by occasional flashes of
vivid lightning.</p>

<p>Fuseli paid much attention, and gave due consideration to the
suggestions of others, respecting his own performances, particularly
with regard to the proportions of his figures, and indeed courted the
observations not only of the learned, but of those also who are
unskilled in the art, and usually profited by their remarks. When Mr.
Ottley, then a very young man, and always an admirer of the Fine Arts,
was introduced to him by Mr. Seward, in the year 1789, he was painting
the picture of "Wolfram introducing Bertram of Navarre to the place
where he had confined his wife with the skeleton of her Lover,"<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
which was exhibited the following year, this gentleman observed, "I like
your composition much, but I think the proportions of the figures in the
back-ground, those, I mean, of the Baron and his friend, too long in the
lower limbs." Fuseli paused for a time, and then answered, "You are
right," and immediately reduced them in height.</p>

<p>In invention, which is not within the rules of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span> art, and therefore may
be considered the highest quality of a poet or a painter; no man has
gone beyond him, and perhaps he possessed this quality in a higher
degree than any other artist, since the restoration of the Fine Arts in
Europe. The <i>portfolios</i> of drawings which he left, fully establish his
claim, in this respect, to his being considered a genius of the first
class, and as such place him in the highest rank of artists, Michael
Angelo and Raphael not excepted. These drawings were made with wonderful
felicity and facility; and a spectator would be astonished to see with
what ease and power he invented and executed them. In telling the story
of the subject, he was never deficient; and the designs made by him
would be enough to occupy the lives of many painters to put them upon
canvass; for there was no very striking incident in the poets in
particular, or in the historians, from Hesiod down to our own times,
which, at some period of his long life, had not been the subject of his
pencil. On his drawings, he usually put the time when, and place where
made; but I know of no instance of his having placed either his name or
a monogram upon a picture.</p>

<p>No artist had a more vivid fancy than Fuseli, or was more happy in
pourtraying superhuman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span> and ideal beings: thus, the visions of Dante and
Spenser, and the poetic flights of Shakspeare and Milton, were stamped
even with originality by his pencil; and those scenes which, from their
difficulty to be represented on paper or on canvass, would deter most
artists from attempting them, were his favourite subjects; and in his
delineation of them, he may generally be placed on a par with, and he
occasionally soars above, the poet. Perhaps to no man can the following
lines be more aptly applied than to Fuseli:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"The poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And, as imagination bodies forth<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The forms of things unknown, the painter's brush<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing<br /></span>
<span class="i4">A local habitation, and a name."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is, therefore, in these visionary scenes in which he shone most, and
which defy competition; for "the daring pencil of Fuseli transports us
beyond the boundaries of nature, and ravishes us with the charm of the
most interesting novelty."<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> In works of this nature, an occasional
extravagance of drawing rather tends to encrease than to diminish their
interest; so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span> he was thus enabled to introduce therein those heroic and
epic forms so peculiar to himself, which do not so well accord with
subjects of sober history. Fuseli frequently invented the subjects of
his pictures without the aid of the poet or historian, as in his
composition of "Ezzelin," "Belisaire," and some others; these he
denominated "philosophical ideas made intuitive, or sentiment
personified." On one occasion he was much amused by the following
enquiry of Lord Byron:&mdash;"I have been looking in vain, Mr. Fuseli, for
some months, in the poets and historians of Italy, for the subject of
your picture of Ezzelin; pray, where is it to be found?" "Only in my
brain, my Lord," was the answer; "for I invented it."</p>

<p>In composition, which has been not inaptly termed "the painter's
invention," he was very happy; for in his productions there are never
"figures to let;" but there is a general link, and one and all tend to
tell the story, and influence the spectator. The disposition and folding
of the drapery were always appropriate and good. He had a high feeling
of grandeur in his male, and of beauty in his female forms: although, in
the former, strength of muscular action is often exaggerated, and in the
latter there is occasionally a degree of apparent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span> voluptuousness; yet
he gave to both great truth of physiognomic expression, being always
intent upon the intellectual part of his art. He was well acquainted
with osteology, or the form and position of the bones in the human body;
in these he seldom erred, although, perhaps, they were often too
strongly marked. He was also skilled in the theory of the anatomy of the
muscles; but as he never painted from, and seldom consulted, living
models after he quitted Italy, except when he occasionally acted as
"visitor in the Life Academy;" so, when he put a figure on paper or on
canvass into a position which he had never seen it assume, either in a
statue or in nature, he was occasionally incorrect in its muscular
action. The models in the "Life Academy" did not tend to correct him in
this, he being more intent upon the progress of the pupils than his own
information: they were therefore usually placed by him in attitudes to
correspond with the antique figures. As no individual form has been
found, in all its parts, to approach, in point of symmetry, to the
celebrated works of the ancient sculptors, so, when Fuseli has been
solicited to paint frequently from life, he has said, "Nature puts me
out;" meaning to convey this notion, that he searched in vain in the
individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span> for that beauty or grandeur which he had mentally
contemplated. Although he was happy in delineating playful scenes, yet
those which create terror or sympathy in the mind, were his general and
favourite subjects, and these he treated with great power; yet, in
carrying the terrible to its utmost limits, I know of no subject from
his pencil calculated to create horror or disgust. He invented and
composed his pictures with great rapidity, and if he thought of a
subject, and had not a canvass of a convenient size, it was frequently
his practice to rub in the new idea upon a finished picture; hence some
of his ablest productions are lost. As his mind was ever intent upon
something new, it cost him an effort to finish a picture; which
disposition, it appears, he inherited; for, in speaking of an ancestor,
Matthias Füessli, who died at Zurich in the year 1665, he thus expresses
himself:&mdash;"His extensive talent was checked by the freaks of an
ungovernable fancy, which seldom suffered him to finish his work. His
subjects, in general, were battles, towns pillaged, conflagrations,
storms."<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>In painting his pictures, Fuseli used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span> indiscriminately the right hand
or the left; but as the latter was more steady, if he were executing
subjects on a small scale, which required more than ordinary neatness of
touch, they were usually performed with the left. And although some of
his small pictures were highly finished, and touched with great
neatness, yet he excelled in those where the figures were of or above
the size of nature.</p>

<p>The subjects of his pencil were never very popular; because they were
generally drawn from poetic imagery, or from classical authors, which
require a poetic eye and mind in the spectator, or a deep knowledge in
the classics, to appreciate properly. He gloried in never having made
his pencil a pander to the public taste, and that he had lived by
painting what pleased himself, and was content to trust to time for a
correct appreciation of his merits. "For when," as he said, "envy shall
no longer hold the balance, the next century will become just, and the
master impede no more the fame of his works." In going home with him one
evening, in a coach, to Somerset House, after having left Mr. Johnson's
house, Bonnycastle being present, Fuseli put to him the following
question:&mdash;"Pray, Bonnycastle, what do you consider the reason that I am
not popular as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span> painter, in a country which has produced Shakspeare
and Milton?" Bonnycastle answered, "Because the public like familiar
subjects, in which there may be individual beauty with fine colouring."
"Is that their taste?" said Fuseli hastily: "then, if I am not their
painter, they are not my critics."</p>

<p>He had a happy method of giving likenesses, from memory, of those
persons whose physiognomic cast of countenance took his fancy; but the
only portraits which he painted regularly from life, were those of Dr.
Priestley, and Mrs. Neunham, a niece of Mr. Johnson's. The portrait of
Dr. Priestley is very characteristic; and Fuseli always felt convinced
that he should have succeeded as a portrait painter, beyond the
expectations of his contemporaries, if he had turned his attention to
that branch of the art.</p>

<p>It has been considered by some, who mistake style for manner, that
Fuseli was in all respects a mannerist. That his pictures always have a
marked and distinguishing character is true; but if he had a manner, it
was peculiarly his own, and it belongs to no other artist. It must
however, in justice, be confessed, that a sort of family-likeness runs
through many of his figures. But if the pictures which composed his
greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span> work, the Milton Gallery, be critically compared, one with the
other, it will be found that, in the invention of them in particular,
few painters have made greater deviations than he has done; no two being
composed or painted upon precisely the same principles.</p>

<p>As a colourist, Fuseli has never ranked high; for in his works there is
generally nothing of that splendour which captivates us in the Venetian
and Dutch schools, as they usually have the sobriety of tone which is
more peculiar to fresco than to oil-painting; he was not unaware of
this, and expresses himself thus, in one of his lectures on colour:&mdash;"Of
this it is not for me to speak, who have courted, and still continue to
court&mdash;colour, as a lover courts a disdainful mistress." But if, by the
term colouring, be meant an adaptation of hues and general tone to the
nature of the subject represented, then he may be considered, in the
strictest sense of the word, a colourist. Yet, if we take a wider range,
we shall find many examples in his pictures which must be acknowledged
by every one to possess fine colour: thus, the back figure of a female
(Sin) in "The bridging of Chaos," the child in "The Lapland Witches,"
and the figure of Sin in the picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span> of "Sin pursued by Death," may be
adduced as unanswerable proofs of this fact.</p>

<p>When the excellence of particular pigments to produce fine colouring has
been the topic of conversation, he has said, "The colours, as now
prepared in England, are sufficently good; it only requires the mind and
eye to adapt, and the hand to regulate them."</p>

<p>In <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">chiar'oscuro</i>, or the art of giving a single figure, or a
composition of figures, their true light and shadow, Fuseli was a
perfect master, and deserves unmixed praise for the breadth of his
masses, and for directing the eye of the spectator to the principal
figures or features in his pictures. In this, perhaps, no master in the
British school has gone beyond him; for in his productions we witness
that union of subject and tone, brought about by a skilful adaptation
and disposition of light and shadow, which we look for in vain in the
works of many other painters.</p>

<p>As a teacher of the Fine Arts, whether Fuseli be considered in his
capacity of Professor of Painting, or in that of Master in the schools
of the Royal Academy, his knowledge stands unrivalled; in the first, for
critical acumen; and in the second, which now more properly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span> comes under
consideration, for the soundness of his judgment, for the accuracy of
his eye, and for the extensive knowledge which he possessed of the works
of the ancient and modern masters. To the students he was a sure guide
and able master, ever ready to assist by his instructions modest merit,
and to repress assumption; and if he felt convinced that a youth was not
likely to arrive at eminence as an artist, he was the first to persuade
him to relinquish that pursuit, rather than proceed in the path which
would only end in ruin or disappointment. He always held the opinion,
however liable to objection, that there is no such thing in the universe
of mind as</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">&mdash;&mdash;"a flower born to blush unseen,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And waste its sweetness on the desert air;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>for every man, he considered, would shew what is in him, and do all that
his nature has qualified him to do. To those who presumed upon a talent
which they did not possess, no man was more severe. It was no uncommon
thing with him, if he found in the Antique Academy a young man careless
about the accuracy of his lines, and intent only upon giving a finished
appearance to his drawing, to cut in, with his sharp thumb nail, a
correct outline, and thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span> spoil, in the opinion of the student, his
elaborate work. That the English school of design gained great
advantages by his appointment of Keeper of the Academy, cannot be
doubted; and, to be convinced of this, it is only necessary to refer to
the able works of living artists, Hilton, Etty, Wilkie, Leslie,
Mulready, Haydon, Briggs, and others, who were his pupils.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the variety of his acquisitions, and his profound
knowledge in, and love for, literature, his "ruling passion" was the
Fine Arts; but he never intruded them as the subject of conversation,
unless pressed to do so. He evinced this "ruling passion strong in
death;" for, just before his last illness, he had sent two pictures for
the then ensuing exhibition of the Royal Academy; the larger one, "A
Scene from Comus," finished; the smaller, "Psyche passing the Fates," in
an unfinished state, intending, as is the common practice with the
Academicians, to glaze and harmonize this picture in the situation where
it was to be placed. Its unfinished condition frequently occupied his
thoughts during his illness, and he, but two days before his death,
spoke of it with great solicitude to Sir Thomas Lawrence, wishing it
either to be withdrawn, or that some painter of talents would harmonize
it for him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span> The last work on which his pencil was employed, and on
which he painted a few days previously to his death, was a scene from
Shakspeare's King John: in this picture, the figure of Lady Constance in
particular, is finely designed, and grief is admirably depicted in her
countenance; he was painting this for James Carrick Moore, Esq., and it
was nearly completed when he died.</p>

<p>The works of art, and the library, which Fuseli left, were disposed of
as follows:&mdash;His drawings and sketches were purchased at a liberal
price, by Sir Thomas Lawrence.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> The Marquis of Bute, the Countess of
Guilford, and other friends, bought pictures and books, at prices named
by myself, to a considerable amount, and the remaining pictures, and the
sketches in oil, were sold by Mr. Christie, and the prints and books by
Mr. Sotheby. A large collection of beautiful drawings, of entomological
subjects, chiefly by Mr. Abbot, of Georgia, in North America, a small
part of which cost him two hundred guineas, were the only articles
reserved, as no sum was offered which was considered as at all adequate
to the value of these, which had been Fuseli's favourite study and
amusement. </p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span></p>

<h2><br /><a name="APPENDIX" id="APPENDIX"></a>APPENDIX.</h2>


<p class="p2">The following article upon the character of Fuseli, as an artist, is
from the pen of William Young Ottley, Esq. F.S.A.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"A very slight comparison of the works of Sir Joshua Reynolds
with the portraits habitually produced by the painters of this
country during the first half of the last century, and whose
merits, for the most part, as pictures, now fit them only for
the housekeeper's room or the garret, will suffice to establish
his claim as a restorer of art and a reformer of public taste.
Somewhat later, Mr. West produced his 'Death of Wolfe,' and some
other pictures representing subjects of our national history,
which much surpassed what had before been done among us in that
way; and in landscape, we had the now justly admired Wilson.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"In the highest department of painting however, which not
improperly may be termed poetic or epic painting, we had still
no artist of any eminence; when in the year 1779, Mr. Fuseli,
after a stay of eight years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span> in Italy, came and settled among
us. Of Mortimer, who had shortly before died young, great
expectations, it is true, had been formed; and we had then also
Cipriani, a Florentine, who, in his way an excellent
draughtsman, long continued uninterruptedly to furnish our
portfolios with pretty designs of sporting Nymphs, Cupids, and
Graces. But the former, although conversant with the human
figure, was too easily led to imitate the deformed and squalid
in nature, and was deficient in greatness of style; and the
genius of the latter wanted the nerve requisite to fit him for
subjects requiring force and expression.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The genius of Mr. Fuseli was of a very different class. An
intimate acquaintance with the learned languages had early
enabled him to fill his mind from the rich storehouses of
ancient poesy; he was all energy and imagination. But in his
youth, not then intending to practise painting professionally,
he had not subjected himself, as an artist, to the restraints of
an academic education. To curb his genius afterwards was
impossible; and to this circumstance we must attribute much of
that fine wildness of character which distinguishes his
performances; not unmixed, it is true, with a certain
exaggeration of manner in the drawing and action of the figures,
but which still no person of fancy would consent to exchange for
the regulated but cold manner too often learned in schools. Had
it been the intention of Mr. Fuseli to devote his pencil to the
representation of subjects of real, sober history, the every-day
occurrences of life, this peculiarity in his style, often
amounting to extravagance, would have been inapplicable. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span> it
has ever been his aim, especially in his larger works, to soar
in the sublime regions of Poetry; and what, it may be asked, is
Poetry, if entirely divested of amplification?</p>

<p class="blockquot">"A style founded upon ordinary nature, such as we see every day,
is certainly ill-fitted to subjects of the above elevated
description; and should it be objected, as a consequence of this
fact, that such subjects are therefore not the proper subjects
for painting at all, may it not be asked, what is then to be
said of many of the greatest works of Michelangiolo, of several
of those of Raffaelle, of the admired performances of Giulio
Romano at Mantua, and of many of the most extensive compositions
even of Rubens? Nor can it be insisted that such cases are not
in point, inasmuch as those artists did not use the same
exaggeration of style in their naked figures as we see in those
of Mr. Fuseli: for, although they did not exaggerate in the same
manner, yet they all did exaggerate; Michelangiolo, by giving to
his figures that immensity of character, which has occasioned
them to be appropriately styled 'a race of giants;' Raffaelle
and Giulio, amongst other things, by encreasing in thickness the
limbs of their figures beyond what nature will commonly be found
to justify; and Rubens, by a mixed augmentation of muscle and
obesity, which, were his figures alive, might, perhaps, be found
to have given them, in most cases, the appearance of encreased
strength, without the reality: to say nothing of Parmigiano,
whose works, though deservedly esteemed, often display, in the
outlines and proportions of the figures, a far greater degree of
extravagance than can generally be detected in those of the
respected Professor of Painting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span> to our Royal Academy.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> But
enough has been said to shew that the greatest artists have not
thought that a style of drawing strictly imitative of common
nature, was well adapted to subjects of an ideal character. It
may be proper that we should now add a few words upon the style
of Mr. Fuseli in particular.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"It is well known that the human figure, trained and disciplined
by gymnastic exercises, presents to the eye an appearance very
different from that which we perceive in the bodies of persons
of inert habits accidentally seen naked, or stripped for the
purpose of being drawn from. The frequent opportunities of
viewing the human figure naked, which were afforded to the
ancient Greek artists, by the public games and festivals used
among them, could not fail to render this familiar to them; and
accordingly, besides the correctness of proportion which we
admire in their works, we find in their statues the nicest
distinctions of this kind, exactly suited to the age, dignity,
and habits of life of the different personages they were
intended to represent. To their figures of Gods and Heroes, it
is well known they were accustomed to give proportions more or
less differing from those which they commonly adopted when
representing the figures of ordinary men; and this variation
from any thing like a common standard is especially observable
in the celebrated colossal statue upon Monte Cavallo, of the
sublime excellence of which all men may now form a judgment from
the bronze cast of it lately erected in one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span> our parks: for,
besides that the arch formed under the breast by the ribs, and
the divisions of the abdominal muscles are more strongly marked
in that statue than in almost all others, the lower limbs bear
to the rest of the figure a greater proportionate length than we
find in perhaps any other example of ancient sculpture. A figure
like this, uniting in the fullest manner strength and activity
with dignity, was peculiarly adapted to subjects of an elevated
and energetic character, such as at all times pressed upon the
imagination of Mr. Fuseli; and accordingly he made its
proportions the basis of his style. If it be urged that he too
constantly kept to the proportions of the above model, it may be
answered that few or none of the painters of modern times have
shewn a disposition to imitate the ancients in that nice
discrimination of character in their naked figures, which has
been noticed above; and it is well known that it has been
objected, even against Michelangiolo, the greatest designer of
all, that the numerous figures in his stupendous 'Last
Judgment,' however varied in attitude, are all of nearly the
same character of form. The fact is, that Mr. Fuseli's style of
design is of the most elevated kind, and consequently best
suited to subjects of a very elevated character.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"In respect of invention, composition, clair-obscure, the works
of Mr. Fuseli generally merit unmixed praise; and although in
the more technical parts of colouring, they have not equal
pretensions, still in this also they deserve commendation; being
commonly painted in that solemn tone of colouring which we
admire in the works of the greatest fresco-painters, and which
Sir Joshua Reynolds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span> observes to be so well adapted to the
higher kind of pictorial representation. As an inventor, he
equals the greatest painters that have lived since the
restoration of the art. No one was ever more fully gifted with
the rare faculty of at once discovering, in the writer he is
perusing, the point of the story, and the moment of time, best
calculated to produce a forcible effect in painting. The loftier
his subject, the more easily he reaches it; and when he
undertakes that at which another artist would tremble, he is the
most sure of success. The truth of this was especially made
manifest in the year 1799, when Mr. Fuseli exhibited publicly a
large collection of his works, under the title of 'The Milton
Gallery;' the subjects of by far the greater part of the
pictures having been taken by him from the 'Paradise Lost.' The
magnificent imagery of this poem, the beautiful, the sublime, or
the terrific character of the personages represented in it, and
of the actions described, all combined to fit it for the display
of the artist's surprising genius in its fullest force; besides
which, the style of Mr. Fuseli was here exactly suited to his
subject. But although the series, as a whole, was one of the
greatest works of painting ever produced, (certainly in its kind
the most perfect,) elevating the painter to the same rank as the
poet; it failed, as the poem itself had originally done, to
ensure to its author that immediate share of public favour which
was his due, and which is sure to be attendant upon successful
endeavours in those inferior branches of the art which are more
within the range of public capacity.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"But the fashion or opinion of the day, in matters of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span> taste, is
not always the judgment of posterity; and it cannot be too much
regretted that the principal pictures of the series, at least,
have not been kept together for the future advantage of our
artists, and the gratification of those whose studies might
hereafter qualify them to appreciate their excellence. For be it
remembered, by such persons as might otherwise be too readily
induced to undervalue that which they do not understand, that
Sir Joshua Reynolds became, in the latter part of his life,
'clearly of opinion that a relish for the higher excellencies of
the art is an acquired taste, which no man ever possessed
without long cultivation, great labour, and attention.'" </p>

<p>The following verses were sent to me anonymously, by the post; as they
shew the author to be well acquainted with the works of Mr. Fuseli, I
trust the reader will think with me, there needs no apology for
inserting them in this place. It is conjectured that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span> they are from the
pen of a young lady, who is alike distinguished for personal attractions
and amiability, as for her taste and knowledge; the daughter of a
gentleman who has been frequently mentioned in this Memoir.</p>


<h4><br />A VISION.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i11">Last night I sunk to sleep's soft power resign'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i11">When wizard Fancy's wand, before my mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i11">Conjur'd in dreams a visionary shew,<br /></span>
<span class="i11">That seem'd with vivid Truth's warm tints to glow.<br /></span>
<span class="i11">By young Favonius' fragrant pinions fann'd,<span class="linenum">5</span><br /></span>
<span class="i11">Amidst Elysian groves I seem'd to stand;<br /></span>
<span class="i11">Here, when th' immortal spirit quits its clay,<br /></span>
<span class="i11">The sons of Genius dwell in endless day:<br /></span>
<span class="i11">Not they who empires founded, or o'erthrew,<br /></span>
<span class="i11">Who conquer'd worlds, or who discover'd new;<span class="linenum">10</span><br /></span>
<span class="i11">Not Philip's headlong son, not Scipio's foe,<br /></span>
<span class="i11">Nor Julius, guilty of his country's woe;<br /></span>
<span class="i11">In these fair fields the scourges of mankind<br /></span>
<span class="i11">Reap'd not the meed to virtuous fame assign'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i11">Here Music sweeps her lyre; her heav'nly lay<span class="linenum">15</span><br /></span>
<span class="i11">The Passions hear, enraptur'd, and obey:<br /></span>
<span class="i11">Here dwells th' immortal Virgin Poesy,<br /></span>
<span class="i11">A noble wildness flashing in her eye;<br /></span>
<span class="i11">Inspired Bards around the Goddess throng,<br /></span>
<span class="i11">And catch the accents flowing from her tongue.<span class="linenum">20</span><br /></span>
<span class="i11">Entranced, whilst gazing on the blissful scene,<br /></span>
<span class="i11">I mark'd a Deity of matchless mien,<br /></span>
<span class="i11">Her port majestic, in each motion grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i11">Fairer she shone than nymphs of mortal race:<br /></span>
<span class="i11">I recognis'd the Sov'reign of that art,<span class="linenum">25</span><br /></span>
<span class="i11">Which through the eye finds entrance to the heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i11">Plac'd on an eminence, she sat alone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i11">"The Master's works contemplate, and decide."<br /></span>
<span class="i11">While speaking thus, her wand on high she rear'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i11">And lo! a train of pictur'd groups appear'd;<span class="linenum">50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i11">Heroic phantoms seem'd to start from night,<br /></span>
<span class="i11">And forms of beauty floated 'fore my sight;<br /></span>
<span class="i11">From ages past reflected scenes arose,<br /></span>
<span class="i11">Of human passions, and eternal woes.<br /></span>

German, may consult the Life of Chevalier Hudlinger, in the preface to
the translation of "Mengs' thoughts on Beauty;" and also a letter "from
Switzerland to Winkelmann;" both of which were written by him without
alteration, although they bear his father's signature.<br /><br /></div>

<div class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Fuseli ever considered Richardson a man of great genius,
and one who had a key to the human heart, and was very indignant, in the
latter period of his life, with a gentleman who spoke contemptuously of
Clarissa Harlowe. This person said in his presence, "No one now reads
the works of Richardson." "Do they not?" said Fuseli, "then by G&mdash;d
they ought. If people are now tired of old novels, I should be glad to
know your criterion of books. If Richardson is old, Homer is obsolete.
Clarissa, to me, is pathetic&mdash;is exquisite; I never read it without
crying like a child."<br /><br /></div>

gentleman closed his mortal career. He died on the 1st of May, 1829, in
his seventy-fifth year. Mr. Füessli was a landscape painter, and held
the honourable situation of President of the Society of Artists at
Zurich. He had been labouring for some years under occasional attacks of
asthma, and died therefrom much regretted.<br /><br /></div>

the names of Sir Joshua Reynolds, Gainsborough, and Wilson, who for
talent in the several departments of the art in which they practised,
have rendered their names immortal.<br /><br /></div>

not to be translated; and in a passage which he quotes from the <i>Acta

interpreters of Homer, for having translated it. It is certain that, in
Homer, the word is declined, not as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#959;&#965;&#964;&#953;&#962; -&#964;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span>, which signifies no

arrangement, for securing to states, within the same sphere of political
action, the possession of their respective territories, and the
continuance of existing rights, is of modern origin, having arisen among
the Italian States, in the fifteenth century. <i>Robertson's Hist. of Ch.
V.</i> v. i. sec. 2.&mdash;But Mr. Hume has attempted to shew that this system,
if not theoretically understood, was at least practically adopted by the
ancient states of Greece, and the neighbouring governments. <i>Essays</i>, v.
1. <i>part 2.</i> <i>Essay 7.</i>&mdash;In adjusting the extent to which these opinions
may be adopted, there is no great difficulty. Wherever mankind have
formed themselves into societies, (and history affords no instance of
their being found in any other,) the conduct of a tribe, or a nation,
has been marked by a general will: and states, like individuals, have
had their antipathies and predilections, their jealousies, and their
fears. The powerful have endeavoured to oppress the weak, and the weak
have sought refuge from the powerful, in their mutual union.
Notwithstanding the great degree of civilization that obtained among the
Grecian States, their political conduct seems to have been directed upon
no higher principle: conquests were pursued as opportunity offered, and
precautions for safety were delayed till the hour of danger arrived. The
preponderating mass of the Roman Republic attracted into it's vortex
whatever was opposed to it's influence: and the violent commotions of
the middle ages, by which that immense body was again broken into new
forms, and impelled in vague and eccentric directions, postponed to a
late period the possibility of regulated action. The transactions in
Italy, during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, bear indeed a
strong resemblance to those which took place among the Grecian States:
but it was not till nearly the close of the latter century that a system
of general security and pacification was clearly developed, and
precautions taken for insuring its continuance. Simple as this idea may
now appear, yet it must be considered, that, before the adoption of it,
the minds of men, and consequently the maxims of states, must have
undergone an important change: views of aggrandizement were to be
repressed; war was to be prosecuted, not for the purpose of conquest,
but of security; and, above all, an eye was to be found that could
discern, and a mind that could comprehend, so extended an object.'<br /><br /></div>

deliberate barbarity, can never be proper subjects of art, because they
exclude the efforts of genius. Even the powers of Shakspeare are
annihilated in the butcheries of Titus Andronicus. Yet the reputation of
some of the most celebrated Italian painters has been principally
founded on this kind of representation. "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ici</span>," says M. Tenhove, "<span

Dutch writer on nearly the same subject with his own, to display a
disparity of manner singularly contrasting with his own sober and
authentic page. Mr. T. is apparently a wit and a man of feeling, but at
all times ready to sacrifice matter to whim, or to substitute assertion
for proof: thus, in talking of the celebrated cameo representing the
punishment of Marsyas, once the property of Lorenzo, he tells us, that
of old it belonged to Nero, who used it as the seal of his
death-warrants, and who probably assumed the attitude of the Apollo
engraved on it, whilst he assisted at the flogging of one Menedemus, a
singer who had excited his jealousy; a tale partly invented, partly
perverted from Suetonius, who tells something similar of Caligula and
Apelles. In another place, (p. 178, note b.) after ridiculing with
somewhat prolix propriety the Florentine custom of substituting, even in
grave writing, the nicknames of their countrymen to their real ones, he
adds, that it is a custom laughed at and disapproved by the rest of
Italian writers, though undoubtedly he had read of Cola di Rienzi,
Massaniello, Titta Borghese, Giorgione, Il Tintoretto, Frà Bastiano, and
Titian himself. "

and the fine arts have been bereaved of the splendid talents of Sir
Thomas Lawrence. This gentleman died, after an illness of a few days
continuance, on the 7th of January, 1830, in the sixty-first year of his
age.
</p><p>
Shortly after Sir Thomas's arrival in London, Fuseli saw "the future
promise" in the youth, and was therefore gratified in making remarks
upon his portraits for his improvement. This kind notice, from a man
whom Sir Thomas held in the highest esteem for talents and various
acquirements, made a deep impression on his mind: he sought an intimacy
with him, which, upon more mature knowledge of the individual, ripened
into the closest friendship. The world is now deprived of these two
great artists, and there can be no other than feelings of deep regret
for their loss. These, however, with regard to myself, are not unmingled
with those of satisfaction, when I consider the many happy hours passed
in their society, and that this pleasure was enjoyed for more than
twenty years.
</p><p>
At the death of Mr. West, in the year 1820, Fuseli was among the most
forward of the Academicians to propose that his friend, Sir Thomas, who
was then on the Continent of Europe, should fill the chair. This honour
he felt due to him, not only for his unrivalled powers as a portrait
painter, but for the elegance of his mind and the urbanity of his
manners. Few men had so pleasing an address; and fewer the happy method
of making this acceptable to the particular persons with whom he
conversed.
</p><p>
Although Sir Thomas Lawrence was not, in the usual acceptation of the
word, a scholar, being unskilled in the dead languages; yet he was well
versed in English literature, had a fine taste for poetry, and I have
heard him recite some lines of his own composition, (full of merit) with
great taste, feeling, and judgment.
</p><p>
Sir Thomas is known to the public chiefly as a portrait painter,&mdash;the
only lucrative branch of the art in England. In this, his style was
truly English. In the countenances of his men we see faithful
likenesses; sometimes certainly given with some degree of flattery; but
he was always the more intent in shewing "the mind's construction in the
face." In his portraits of heroes there is always dignity; in those of
statesmen, depth of thought, with firmness of character. In the
delineation of females, in which he chiefly shone, beauty and delicacy
were combined with great taste of attitudes, and which was heightened by
the elegance and disposition of their drapery. His backgrounds were
always appropriate to the portraits; and when his pencil was employed on
large pictures, these were introduced with great taste and power.
</p><p>
The drawings of the human face in black lead pencil, frequently
heightened with a little colour, which he sometimes made to present to
his friends, exceed all praise, for truth, delicacy, and fine finish.
</p><p>
Had public encouragement gone hand in hand with the powers of the man,
we should, no doubt, have possessed some fine epic and dramatic subjects
from his pencil. As a proof of this, I may again be permitted to advert
to the sublime picture of "Satan calling up his Legions," which was
purchased by the late Duke of Norfolk, and came again into the
possession of Sir Thomas, when his Grace's effects were sold: here we
see an epic subject of the highest class treated with invention, great
power of drawing, and brilliancy of colouring. This, with "Homer
reciting his Verses to the Greeks," are the only historical pictures
from his pencil that I am acquainted with, and perhaps the only ones
known. In this advanced stage of my work, I may be excused for giving
only a brief sketch of my friend, whose loss every admirer of the fine
arts in Europe deeply deplores;&mdash;a man whose name will go down to
posterity coupled with those of the great masters who have preceded him
in the pictorial art; and as the present high appreciation of his merits
does not rest upon adventitious circumstances, time will rather add to
than detract from his fame.</p></div>

no one for whom he entertained a higher regard than for Mr. Samuel
Cartwright; he has said to me, "Cartwright is a friendly, liberal man,
and has the mind of a gentleman."<br /><br /></div>

<div class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_63_63" id="Footnote_63_63"></a><a href="#FNanchor_63_63"><span class="label">[63]</span></a> At this time, his age could not be accurately ascertained:

<div class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_65_65" id="Footnote_65_65"></a><a href="#FNanchor_65_65"><span class="label">[65]</span></a> Fuseli made this remark in reference to the capital
employed, and the encouragement given to the Slave Trade by some of the
merchants of Liverpool, and the consequent wealth which was derived by
many from this traffic. Every one who is acquainted with the
parliamentary history of this country knows the arduous struggle made
for its abolition, and the part which Mr. Roscoe took, when member of
parliament for Liverpool, to effect this measure. In these efforts he
was cordially joined by many of his intelligent and liberal townsmen.<br /><br /></div>

Reynolds, were written at Hastings, in the year 1813, shortly after the

<h3>TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES</h3>
<p>1. Accents and breathings in the Greek quotations have been left
unchanged (both are included somewhat at random).  The one exception is the rough breathing before &#7944;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#945;&#963;&#953; in footnote 17, which should be a smooth breathing.</p>

<p>2. Obvious typos have been silently corrected.</p>

<p>3. Alternative spellings have been left unchanged. This includes words
in poetry such as "ravish'd" for "ravished", words sometimes hyphenated,
and the various spellings of painters' names (there are at least four
different spellings of Michelangelo, and three of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">chiar'oscuro</span>, for
example).</p>

<p>4. Chapter headings (in chapters II, VIII,
XIII and XV) vary slightly from the wording of the Table of Contents.
These variants have been left unchanged, with one exception: the date
1703 in the heading for Chapter II has been corrected to 1763.</p>

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

1.E.9.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
